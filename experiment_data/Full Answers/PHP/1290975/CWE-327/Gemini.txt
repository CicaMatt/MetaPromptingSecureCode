/* Regarding the speed bonus:
Prepared statements offer performance benefits primarily in scenarios with repeated execution of the same query with different parameters.  The database server can cache the query plan, reducing the overhead of parsing and optimizing the SQL each time.  

For only three or four executions on a page, the performance gain might be negligible.  However, it's still a best practice to use prepared statements for their security benefits (preventing SQL injection). If you anticipate scaling up with many queries, the benefits will become more significant. */

**Explanation and Security Considerations:**

1. **Database Connection:**  The code establishes a connection using `mysqli`, the improved MySQL extension.  Replace placeholders with your actual database credentials.

2. **Prepared Statement:** The core of the solution uses `$conn->prepare()` to prepare the SQL query. Placeholders (`?`) are used for the parameters.

3. **Input Sanitization:** Critically, input from the URL parameters (`$_GET`) is sanitized using `$conn->real_escape_string()`. This is *essential* to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities. It escapes special characters that could be maliciously used to alter the SQL query.

4. **Parameter Binding:** `$stmt->bind_param("ss", $userid, $category)` binds the sanitized input values to the placeholders.  The `"ss"` specifies the data types of the parameters (string in this case).

5. **Execution and Result Handling:** `$stmt->execute()` runs the prepared query. The results are retrieved and processed.  `$result->free()` releases the result set memory.  Error handling is included.

6. **Closing Connections:** It's good practice to close the prepared statement and the database connection when finished.


This revised solution addresses the original problem of SQL injection vulnerabilities by using parameterized queries (prepared statements) and input sanitization, adhering to security best practices.  The comment about performance clarifies the potential benefits and when they become most relevant.
