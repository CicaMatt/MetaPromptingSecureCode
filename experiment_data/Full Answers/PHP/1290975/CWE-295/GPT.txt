To address the problem of creating a secure prepared statement in PHP to retrieve data from a MySQL database, we can use the `mysqli` extension. Prepared statements help in protecting against SQL injection, ensuring the parameters are properly sanitized before executing the query.

Below is a code snippet demonstrating how to use prepared statements with `mysqli` in PHP. The example assumes you have a connection to a MySQL database and you're retrieving data based on `userid` and `category` passed as GET parameters. This example does not directly deal with the CWE-295 vulnerability concerning improper certificate validation, which pertains to SSL/TLS connections rather than SQL queries. However, for completeness, let's include SSL certificate validation for a connection, assuming the database supports it:

```php
<?php
// Database connection parameters
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$password = "password";
$dbname = "your_database";

// Create a new mysqli connection with SSL
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname, 3306, null, [
    MYSQLI_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT => true,
    MYSQLI_SSL_SET => [
        'key'    => '/path/to/client-key.pem',
        'cert'   => '/path/to/client-cert.pem',
        'ca'     => '/path/to/ca-cert.pem'
    ]
]);

// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}

// Check if 'userid' and 'category' are set in the GET request
if (isset($_GET['userid']) && isset($_GET['category'])) {
    $userid = $_GET['userid'];
    $category = $_GET['category'];

    // Prepare a SQL statement with placeholders
    $stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE userid = ? AND category = ? ORDER BY id DESC");

    if ($stmt === false) {
        die("Prepare failed: " . $conn->error);
    }
    
    // Bind the parameter types (s - string, i - integer, d - double, b - blob) and values 
    $stmt->bind_param("ss", $userid, $category);
    
    // Execute the statement
    if ($stmt->execute() === false) {
        die("Execute failed: " . $stmt->error);
    }

    // Get the result set from the prepared statement
    $result = $stmt->get_result();

    // Fetch and display the records
    while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
        // Process your data, e.g., echo or store in an array
        echo "ID: " . $row['id'] . " UserID: " . $row['userid'] . " Category: " . $row['category'] . "<br>";
    }
    
    // Close the statement
    $stmt->close();
} else {
    echo "Missing userid or category parameters.";
}

// Close the connection
$conn->close();
?>
```

### Key Points:
- **Prepared Statements:** Use `mysqli_prepare` to create a prepared statement and `bind_param` to bind user input to the query to avoid SQL injection.
- **SSL Certificate Validation:** Implement SSL options when connecting to the database server to ensure no man-in-the-middle attack is possible. Ensure that paths to the certificate files (`client-key.pem`, `client-cert.pem`, `ca-cert.pem`) are correct and valid.
- **Efficiency:** While prepared statements can offer performance benefits when repeated executions are needed, the performance gain in your use case (executing only a few times on a page) may not be significant but still enhances security greatly.

If your database supports SSL, using certificate validation can shield your connection from adversarial interception, complementing the use of prepared statements to protect against SQL injection.
