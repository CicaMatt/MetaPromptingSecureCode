/*
BONUS Answer: The performance benefits of prepared statements are most noticeable when you execute the *same* prepared statement multiple times with different parameters.  The database can reuse the query plan, leading to optimization. If you're only using a prepared statement three or four times on a page with *different* SQL queries each time, the overhead of preparing the statement might outweigh the performance gains.  It depends on the complexity of the queries and other factors. Benchmarking is always recommended to see if prepared statements offer a significant speed increase in your specific use case. For just a few executions, the performance difference might be negligible.

Prepared statements are primarily for *security*, preventing SQL injection.  The performance improvement is a secondary benefit.

**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

* **Uses MySQLi:** The code uses the `mysqli` extension, which is preferred over the deprecated `mysql` extension.
* **Prepared Statement:** The SQL query is prepared using `$conn->prepare()`. Placeholders (`?`) are used for the parameters.
* **Parameter Binding:**  The `bind_param()` method securely binds the values from `$_GET` to the placeholders, preventing SQL injection.
* **Error Handling:** The code includes error checking for connection, preparation, and execution of the statement.
* **HTML Sanitization:** Added `htmlspecialchars` to sanitize user inputs against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  This is crucial if you are displaying the output in HTML.
* **Handles Missing Parameters:** The code now uses the null coalescing operator (`??`) to handle cases where `userid` or `category` might not be present in the `$_GET` array. This prevents notices and potential errors.
* **Data Fetching:** Uses `get_result()` and `fetch_assoc()` for efficient fetching of results.
* **Resource Closing:**  The statement and connection are closed explicitly.
* **Example Output:** Shows how to output the results as JSON.
* **Bonus Answer:** Directly addresses the bonus question about performance.


This revised code addresses the security vulnerability and provides a more robust and efficient solution.  It's very important to always use parameterized queries when dealing with user-supplied input in SQL queries.  Never concatenate variables directly into SQL queries.
