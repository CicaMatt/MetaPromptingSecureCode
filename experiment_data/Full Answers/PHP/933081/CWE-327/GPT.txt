To address the issue of implementing a `try-catch` statement in PHP for handling file upload errors, you can modify the original code snippet to make it more robust. Additionally, it's important to ensure that common mistakes in cryptographic practices are not made, especially in a larger context of your applications.

Here's how you can effectively refactor the original code to implement a `try-catch` statement:

```php
<?php
try {
    // Check if the file was uploaded without errors
    if (!is_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'])) {
        throw new RuntimeException('Invalid file upload attempt.');
    }

    // Destination where the file will be moved
    $destinationPath = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/uploads/' . basename($_FILES['file']['name']);

    // Attempt to move the uploaded file
    $move = move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $destinationPath);

    // Check if the file was successfully moved
    if (!$move) {
        throw new RuntimeException('File didn\'t upload.');
    }

    // If successful, inform the user
    echo 'Upload Complete!';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle exceptions by showing an error message to the user
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`try-catch` Structure**: 
   - The `try` block contains the code that might throw an exception.
   - The `catch` block handles any exceptions that are thrown. Here, it's using `Exception` but could be customized with more specific exception classes (e.g., `RuntimeException`).

2. **Upload Verification**:
   - `is_uploaded_file()` ensures that the file is a valid uploaded file, offering another layer of verification.

3. **File Path Safety**:
   - `basename()` is used to extract the original file name, preventing directory traversal attacks.

4. **Exception Handling**:
   - If the conditions for a successful upload aren't met, an exception is thrown with a corresponding error message.

5. **Overall Security Enhancements**:
   - By properly catching exceptions, the system avoids abrupt script termination (`die`), allowing for cleaner error handling and logging if needed.
  
This approach not only fulfills the requirement of converting the logic into a `try-catch` format but also lays a foundation for better robustness and error handling in your PHP applications. 

For cryptographic security, remember to apply the mitigation strategies like using strong algorithms, reviewing implementations periodically, and using reliable libraries as mentioned in your problem guidelines.
