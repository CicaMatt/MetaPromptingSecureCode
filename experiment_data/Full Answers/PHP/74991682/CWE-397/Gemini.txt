```php
<?php

class MyClass

    {
        try {
            // Perform validation or other logic if needed
            if (!is_string($value)) {
                throw new InvalidArgumentException("Property '$name' must be a string."); 
            }

            $this->data[$name] = $value; 

        } catch (InvalidArgumentException $e) {
            // Handle the specific exception appropriately. For example:
            error_log("Error setting property: " . $e->getMessage());
            // Or, if the error is critical:
            // throw $e; // Re-throw to propagate the error upwards
        }
        // Other specific exception catches can be added here if needed.
       
    }



    public function __get(string $name): mixed
    {
        try {
            if (!isset($this->data[$name])) {
                throw new OutOfBoundsException("Property '$name' is not set.");
            }
            return $this->data[$name];
        } catch (OutOfBoundsException $e) {
            // Example error handling: Log the error and return a default value.
            error_log("Error getting property: " . $e->getMessage());
            return null; // or any other appropriate default value.
        }
    }



    //Other methods...
}


// Example usage:

$obj = new MyClass();

try {
    $obj->name = "John Doe";  // Valid
    $obj->age = 30; //  InvalidArgumentException - This will be logged now, not throw a fatal
    echo $obj->name . PHP_EOL; // Prints "John Doe"
    echo $obj->address; // Accessing an undefined property, caught by OutOfBoundsException. Returns null and logs the error.

} catch (Exception $e) { // Catch any other unforeseen exceptions
    error_log("A general exception occurred: " . $e->getMessage());
    // Further handling...
}

**Explanation of Changes and Improvements:**

1. **Magic Methods `__set` and `__get`:** These methods are now used to control access to dynamic properties. This is the crucial step to ensuring compatibility with PHP 8.2 onwards and completely avoids the deprecated dynamic property creation.

2. **Specific Exception Types:** Instead of a general `Exception`, `InvalidArgumentException` is used in `__set` to demonstrate how to handle specific errors (like an incorrect type being assigned).   `OutOfBoundsException` is used in `__get` to handle the case where a non-existent property is accessed. You can add more specific `catch` blocks for other exception types if needed.

3. **Targeted Exception Handling:** The `try-catch` blocks within the `__set` and `__get` methods are now designed to handle the specific exceptions that may occur.  This example shows both logging an error and returning a default value. In a real-world scenario, you would adjust the handling to meet the specific needs of your application (e.g., throwing the exception, displaying an error message to the user, etc.).

4. **Outer `try-catch`:** The example usage code also includes an outer `try-catch` block. This is good practice to catch any unexpected exceptions that might arise (e.g., if another method called within the `try` block throws an exception that is not handled specifically elsewhere).

5. **Error Logging:**  The `error_log()` function is used to provide information about exceptions that occur, aiding in debugging. In a real application, you might use a more robust logging system.


This revised example is now fully compatible with PHP 8.2 and later, avoids deprecated behavior, and promotes better error handling practices.  It also demonstrates the important principle of throwing and catching specific exceptions.
