**Explanation and Key Improvements:**

1. **Secure Key Storage:** The code retrieves the encryption key from an environment variable `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_KEY`. This is a more secure approach than hardcoding the key.  In a real-world application, consider using a dedicated secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for enhanced security.

2. **OpenSSL:**  The code uses `openssl_encrypt` and `openssl_decrypt`, which are more modern and recommended over the deprecated `mcrypt` extension.

3. **Explicit Padding:** The code uses `OPENSSL_RAW_DATA` and handles padding manually. This gives greater control and helps ensure compatibility with the payment processor's system. While the code now includes the IV along with the ciphertext which matches the Perl output, it is crucial to understand the padding mechanism used by the payment gateway. Experiment with `OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING` or including `OPENSSL_PKCS1_PADDING` in the `openssl_encrypt` function if the current output doesn't match.

4. **IV (Initialization Vector):** The code uses a randomly generated Initialization Vector (IV) with `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes`. Using a random IV for each encryption operation significantly strengthens the security of Triple DES in ECB mode. The IV is prepended to the ciphertext, base64 encoded along with the ciphertext, and then separated during decryption. This makes the encryption more robust and less vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks.


**To run this code:**

1. **Set the environment variable:**
   ```bash
   export PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_KEY="123412341234123412341234"  # Replace with your actual key.
   ```
2. **Execute the PHP script:**
   ```bash
   php your_script_name.php
   ```

Remember to replace the example key with your actual key retrieved from a secure location. This enhanced solution prioritizes security by avoiding hardcoded credentials and using modern, robust encryption practices. It also provides more control over the encryption process to achieve interoperability with the payment processor's Perl implementation.
