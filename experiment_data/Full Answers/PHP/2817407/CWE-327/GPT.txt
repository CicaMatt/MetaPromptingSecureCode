To correctly reproduce the token expected by the payment processor using PHP, it is crucial to ensure consistency in key management, padding scheme, and encryption mode. Comparing with the Perl example that produced the expected result, we need to use the same encryption mode and padding (usually PKCS#7 for block ciphers) to ensure compatibility.

Given the disparity in the original PHP attempt, the solution involves using the `mcrypt` library with careful attention to details like the initialization vector (IV) and padding. However, since the `mcrypt` extension is deprecated in PHP 7.1.0 and removed as of PHP 7.2.0, it's recommended to use the OpenSSL extension, which is the more updated and supported library.

Here's how you can implement the desired TripleDES encryption in PHP using OpenSSL:

```php
<?php

// Target parameters
$theKey = "123412341234123412341234";
$theString = "username=test123";

// The OpenSSL method
$cipherMethod = 'des-ede3';

// OpenSSL requires an initialization vector. For ECB mode, it should be NULL.
$options = OPENSSL_RAW_DATA | OPENSSL_NO_PADDING;

// OpenSSL requires padding to the block size, emulate PKCS7 padding.
$blockSize = openssl_cipher_iv_length($cipherMethod);
$paddingLength = $blockSize - (strlen($theString) % $blockSize);
$theString .= str_repeat(chr($paddingLength), $paddingLength);

// Encrypt using OpenSSL
$encryptedData = openssl_encrypt($theString, $cipherMethod, $theKey, $options);

// Base64 encoding the encrypted data
$strEncodedEnc = base64_encode($encryptedData);

echo "Resulting string: " . $strEncodedEnc;
?>
```

### Key Points:
- **Cipher Method**: We use `des-ede3` which is OpenSSL's identifier for TripleDES.
- **OpenSSL Options**: Use `OPENSSL_RAW_DATA` to get binary data instead of base64 encoded output and `OPENSSL_NO_PADDING` since we manually padded.
- **Manual Padding**: OpenSSL does not automatically apply padding unless specified, so emulating PKCS7 padding ensures blocks are complete.
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Not needed (or should be null) for ECB mode, hence not used or set explicitly.

### Mitigation Strategies Applied:
- **Adopt Strong Algorithms**: Although TripleDES was used here for compatibility, generally adopt stronger encryption such as AES.
- **Use Reliable Libraries**: Utilizing OpenSSL, a widely supported library, ensures better compatibility and security.
- **Correct Implementation**: Carefully following required padding and encryption modes to meet expected outputs by the service.

Always remember to migrate and update to stronger algorithms like AES for long-term security improvements in real-world applications.
