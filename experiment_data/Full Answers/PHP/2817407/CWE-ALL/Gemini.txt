**Explanation and Mitigation Strategies Applied:**

* **CWE-259 & CWE-798 (Hard-coded Credentials):**  The encryption key is now read from an external configuration file (config.php), which in turn can be configured to fetch the key from an environment variable. This prevents the key from being hardcoded in the source code.  The example shows how to use `getenv()` to retrieve the key from an environment variable. Store this key securely.
* **CWE-327 (Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm):** The code uses `openssl_encrypt()` with `des-ede3-cbc` (Triple DES with CBC mode) and a randomly generated IV. This addresses the use of the outdated and insecure ECB mode used in the original PHP code.  `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` is used for secure IV generation.  Zero padding is explicitly set to match the Perl code's behavior.  Triple DES is outdated and should be replaced with AES-256 if possible after coordinating with the payment processor.
* **CWE-477 (Use of Obsolete Function):** The obsolete `mcrypt_ecb` function is replaced by the modern and recommended `openssl_encrypt()` function.
* **CWE-397:** Specific exceptions are caught (\RuntimeException).
* **CWE-295 & CWE-798 (relating to the payment gateway):** The code itself does not directly address certificate validation as that's a concern on the communication layer with the payment processor. Ensure your HTTPS connections to the payment gateway are properly configured and validate the payment processor's certificate.  Do not disable certificate verification.  Also, consider the security implications of the payment gateway requiring such an outdated encryption method. It's best to discuss upgrading to a stronger encryption standard with the payment processor.


**Key improvements:**

* **Stronger Encryption:**  Uses CBC mode with a random IV, addressing the vulnerability of ECB mode.
* **Secure Key Management:**  Key is loaded from external configuration, avoiding hardcoding.
* **Modern Cryptography Library:** Uses OpenSSL, a robust and well-maintained library.
* **Error Handling:** Includes error handling and logging.


This solution provides a more secure and robust way to perform Triple DES encryption in PHP, addressing the vulnerabilities present in the original code snippets. Remember to securely manage your encryption key and work with the payment processor to upgrade to a more secure encryption standard if possible.
