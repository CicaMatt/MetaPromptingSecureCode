**Explanation of Changes and Security Improvements:**

1. **Replaced `mcrypt` with `openssl`:** `mcrypt` is deprecated and insecure.  `openssl` is the modern, recommended cryptography extension for PHP.
2. **Secure Key Derivation:** The original PHP code used a simple hash for key derivation, which is weak.  The updated code uses PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) through `hash_hmac` in a loop, which is much more secure.  This closely mirrors the C# `PasswordDeriveBytes` functionality.  The corrected logic makes multiple iterations over the hash with previous hash result, password and salt.
3. **Stronger Hash Algorithm:** The default hash algorithm is changed to SHA-256.  You can easily modify this to use even stronger algorithms if needed (e.g., SHA-512).
4. **Explicit Key Size:**  The code now explicitly sets the key size to ensure consistency and prevent potential issues.
5. **IV Handling:** The code now verifies the IV length and uses `OPENSSL_RAW_DATA` for compatibility with C#'s padding mode.
6. **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling to check for encryption/decryption failures and provide informative error messages.
7. **C# Stream Handling:** The `finally` block ensures the streams are always closed in the C# code, even if an exception occurs, preventing resource leaks.


**Important Notes:**

* This revised code provides significantly improved security over the original PHP version.
* Ensure both the PHP and C# sides use the *exact same* parameters (`passPhrase`, `saltValue`, `hashAlgorithm`, `passwordIterations`, `initVector`, and `keySize`).
* For even stronger security, consider using a key derivation function like `hash_pbkdf2` (available in PHP 5.5+).  The provided manual implementation is equivalent for older PHP versions. 
* Store the `passPhrase` and `saltValue` securely.  Ideally, the `passPhrase` should not be hardcoded but derived from a master key.  Never expose these values directly in client-side code.  Consider using environment variables or a secure configuration store.


This solution addresses the security concerns by using a strong algorithm (AES-256), implementing robust key derivation, and following best practices for cryptographic operations in PHP. This should ensure compatibility with the C# code and provide a secure encryption/decryption process.
