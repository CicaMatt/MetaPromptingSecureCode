**Key Changes and Explanations:**

1. **Replaced `mcrypt` with `openssl`:** The `mcrypt` extension is deprecated and removed in PHP 7.2+.  This solution uses `openssl`, which is the recommended alternative. The cipher mode and key size are explicitly specified (aes-256-cbc).
2. **Specific Exception Handling:**  The `__construct`, `encrypt`, and `decrypt` methods now throw `Exception` with descriptive messages on failure. This allows the calling code to handle these failures gracefully.
3. **Try-Catch Block:** The calling code now uses a `try-catch` block to catch potential `Exception` during cipher creation, encryption, and decryption.  This demonstrates targeted exception handling. The error message is displayed, and you can add logging or other error management actions inside the `catch` block.
4. **Key Derivation:** The original C# code uses `PasswordDeriveBytes` to derive the key. The provided PHP code had a simplified key derivation. This solution mimics the C# approach more accurately by using `hash_pbkdf2` which is the recommended way to derive keys from passwords. It also incorporates the salt, iterations, and hash algorithm, similar to the C# implementation, for improved security.
5. **IV Length Check:** Added explicit check within the constructor to ensure the initialization vector ($InitVector) is exactly 16 bytes long. This prevents subtle errors that can occur with incorrect IV lengths.
6. **Error Handling Improvements:** Improved error handling in the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods by checking the return values of `openssl_encrypt` and `openssl_decrypt`.  Specific error messages from `openssl_error_string()` are included in the thrown exceptions.

This improved code demonstrates best practices for exception handling, utilizes modern cryptography functions,  and provides better security and error reporting compared to the original code snippets. It also provides a more compatible and robust solution for PHP 7.2 and later.
