Key improvements:

* **No hardcoded credentials:**  The example doesn't use credentials, so this CWE is not applicable.  If database interaction or external services were required, proper credential management (external configuration, environment variables) would be essential.
* **No SSL certificate validation required:** The provided context doesn't involve SSL, but if HTTPS were used, certificate validation using trusted CAs and potentially certificate pinning (if appropriate) would be crucial.
* **Stronger cryptography (if applicable):**  No sensitive data requiring encryption is handled directly.  If password handling or other sensitive data storage were involved, using robust, modern algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 for password hashing and AES-256 or stronger for encryption would be necessary.  `random_bytes()` is used for filename generation, providing cryptographically secure random numbers.
* **Specific exception handling:** `try...catch` with specific `Exception` types is implemented in the image re-processing stage to provide better error reporting and handling. Generic exception handling is avoided.
* **No obsolete functions:**  The code uses current, recommended functions for file and image handling.
* **Image re-processing:** The image is re-processed using GD to mitigate potential exploits embedded in image metadata or structure.
* **Unique filenames:**  Uses `random_bytes()` to generate cryptographically secure random filenames, preventing overwriting of existing files and making it harder for attackers to predict file locations.
* **Stricter MIME and Extension checking:** Combines MIME type and extension checks to help prevent mismatches.
* **File Upload Attacks:**  Uses `is_uploaded_file()` to verify that the file was indeed uploaded via HTTP POST, mitigating potential file inclusion attacks.
* **Error Handling:** More comprehensive error handling and reporting.


**Additional Security Hardenings (outside the code example):**

* **.htaccess protection:** Place a `.htaccess` file in the `uploads` directory with rules to prevent PHP execution (extremely important!):

```
<FilesMatch "\.(php|php.*)$">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>
```

* **Server-side security:** Ensure your web server is configured securely, keeping software updated, and applying security patches.
* **Input validation:**  Although basic input validation is present, consider more rigorous checks for unexpected characters or patterns in filenames.
* **Output encoding:**  Encode any user-supplied data before displaying it to prevent XSS vulnerabilities (not shown in the upload example but critical for any subsequent display of filenames).
* **Least Privilege:** Ensure the webserver process has only the minimum necessary permissions on the `uploads` directory.




This significantly improved example addresses the core security concerns raised in the problem statement and provides a more robust foundation for secure image uploads. Remember that security is an ongoing process. Regular auditing and updates are vital.
