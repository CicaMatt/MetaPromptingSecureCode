To help caching in a PHP application while using an older PHP version like 5.1.0 or 5.2.9, you can set appropriate HTTP caching headers. However, the functions you're using (`session_cache_limiter` and specific headers) aren't deprecated, so addressing caching concerns and setting headers properly will focus on using the correct ones for your context.

Here's a basic approach to implementing caching in your PHP application:

1. Set `Cache-Control` headers so browsers and any intermediate proxies can cache the content.

2. Use `Etag` or `Last-Modified` headers to enable efficient cache validation, where clients can validate content with the server.

3. Consider using output buffering to capture the dynamically generated output and store it in the filesystem or a simple custom caching mechanism for your static parts.

Here's a code snippet example:

```php
<?php
// Cache settings
$cacheDuration = 3600; // Cache duration in seconds (1 hour)
$lastModifiedTime = filemtime(__FILE__); // Assuming the file's last modified time for demo purposes
$etag = md5_file(__FILE__); // Using file's MD5 hash as an ETag for demo purposes

// Set headers for caching
header("Cache-Control: public, max-age=$cacheDuration"); // Public allow browser/proxy caching
header("Pragma: cache"); // HTTP/1.0 backward compatibility
header("Expires: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", time() + $cacheDuration) . " GMT");
header("Last-Modified: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", $lastModifiedTime) . " GMT");
header("Etag: $etag");

// Evaluate sent headers from client for conditional GET
if (@strtotime($_SERVER['HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE']) == $lastModifiedTime ||
    trim($_SERVER['HTTP_IF_NONE_MATCH']) == $etag) {
    // Client's cache is up-to-date, no need to resend the resource, send 304 Not Modified
    header("HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified");
    exit;
}

// Contents of the actual page
echo "<html>";
echo "<head><title>Your Page</title></head>";
echo "<body>";
echo "<h1>Welcome to the cached page</h1>";
echo "<p>This content is cached for $cacheDuration seconds.</p>";
echo "</body>";
echo "</html>";
```

### Explanation
1. **Cache-Control**: Sets a `public` directive indicating that responses can be cached by clients and proxy servers. The `max-age=3600` specifies that the response is considered fresh for 1 hour.

2. **Pragma**: Used for backward compatibility with HTTP/1.0 caches.

3. **Expires**: Provides a specific date/time after which the response is considered stale.

4. **Last-Modified**: Informs clients when the content was last changed.

5. **Etag**: Provides a unique identifier for the requested resource, allowing web caches to be more efficient when files have not changed.

6. **Conditional GET with `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match`**: If the client's copy is up-to-date, responding with `304 Not Modified` reduces bandwidth by not resending unchanged content.

This setup uses file modification times and ETags to determine content freshness. You can modify these to better fit actual dynamic content updates in your real application.
