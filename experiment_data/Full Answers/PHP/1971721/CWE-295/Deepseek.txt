To address the caching issue in your PHP 5.1.0+ website, you can implement basic caching using HTTP headers. This will help browsers and proxies cache your pages effectively. Below is a PHP code snippet that sets the necessary headers to enable caching for your dynamically generated but mostly static pages.

### PHP Code Snippet for Basic Caching

```php
<?php
// Set the cache control headers
header("Cache-Control: public, max-age=180"); // Cache publicly for 180 seconds (3 minutes)
header("Pragma: cache"); // For HTTP/1.0 compatibility
header("Expires: " . gmdate("D, d M Y H:i:s", time() + 180) . " GMT"); // Set expiration time to 180 seconds from now

// Set the content type and charset
$documentMimeType = "text/html"; // Example MIME type
$documentCharset = "UTF-8"; // Example charset
header("Content-type: $documentMimeType; charset=$documentCharset");

// Set the Vary header to handle different content based on Accept headers
header('Vary: Accept');

// Set the content language
$currentLanguage = "en"; // Example language
header("Content-language: $currentLanguage");

// Your dynamic content generation logic here
// For example:
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>";
?>
```

### Explanation of Headers

1. **Cache-Control**:  
   - `public`: Indicates that the response can be cached by any cache, including proxies and shared caches.
   - `max-age=180`: Specifies the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that the response can be cached. Here, it's set to 180 seconds (3 minutes).

2. **Pragma**:  
   - `cache`: This is used for HTTP/1.0 compatibility. It tells older clients to cache the response.

3. **Expires**:  
   - This header sets an expiration date for the cached content. The value is set to 180 seconds from the current time.

4. **Content-type**:  
   - Specifies the MIME type and charset of the content being served.

5. **Vary**:  
   - `Accept`: This header tells caches that the content may vary based on the `Accept` header sent by the client. This is useful if your content changes based on the client's preferences (e.g., language, encoding).

6. **Content-language**:  
   - Specifies the language of the content being served.

### Additional Considerations

- **Session Cache Limiter**:  
  If you are using sessions, you might want to set the session cache limiter to `public` instead of `private` to allow caching of pages that use sessions. This can be done using `session_cache_limiter('public');`.

- **Dynamic Content**:  
  If parts of your content are dynamic and should not be cached, you can use conditional logic to set different cache headers for those parts.

- **Cache Invalidation**:  
  If your content changes, you need a mechanism to invalidate the cache. This can be done by changing the URL or using a versioning system (e.g., appending a query string like `?v=2`).

This basic caching setup should help improve the performance of your website by reducing the load on your server and improving the user experience.
