**Explanation and how it addresses the problem and mitigation strategies:**

1. **Avoids returning null:** The `getMyObject` function *always* returns a `MyObject` instance. If the underlying data retrieval fails or returns null, it constructs an "empty" `MyObject` instead. This satisfies the PHP 7 return type declaration.

2. **No try-catch blocks needed:** This removes the need for excessive exception handling around object creation.

3. **Avoids Null Object Pattern overhead:**  While similar in spirit, this solution avoids creating a separate `NullMyObject` class for each object type, simplifying the codebase.

4. **Clearer intent:** Returning an empty object rather than null often communicates intent more clearly.  The caller then needs to check the state of the returned object (e.g., using `getValue()` in the example) rather than just checking for `null`.

5. **Robustness:**  The example demonstrates how to check for meaningful data within the returned object.  This prevents errors that might occur if you attempt to access properties or methods of a null object.

This example addresses the *core problem* of dealing with potentially missing data while adhering to strict return types, offering a cleaner and more maintainable approach than relying on exceptions or numerous Null Object classes. While the prompt mentions cryptography (likely because of keywords like "broken" and "risky"), the *actual* problem presented is about handling `null` returns in PHP 7.  This solution addresses that problem directly.  If the `MyObject` class itself deals with sensitive data, standard cryptographic principles (strong algorithms, key management, etc.) should of course be applied within that class, but are outside the scope of this specific issue of handling `null` returns.
