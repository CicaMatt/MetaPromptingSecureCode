To handle the scenario of returning a `null` value while maintaining type safety and avoiding excessive use of exceptions, you can use the concept of Optionals or a similar pattern that's available in PHP. Since PHP 8.0 introduced union types, you can define multiple acceptable return types, effectively allowing `null` as one of the possible return values.

Here's how you might implement a solution in PHP 8 that handles this situation gracefully:

```php
<?php

class MyObject {
    public function __construct() {
        // Initialization code here
    }
}

class MyObjectProvider {
    /**
     * This method returns an instance of MyObject or null,
     * allowing for natural handling of 'no object' scenarios.
     *
     * @return MyObject|null
     */
    public function getMyObject(): ?MyObject {
        // Your logic to fetch or create an object
        // Returning null to demonstrate handling of a 'no object' scenario
        return null; // Or return new MyObject() if an object is available
    }
}

function handleMyObject(MyObjectProvider $provider): void {
    $myObject = $provider->getMyObject();
    
    if ($myObject === null) {
        // Handle the case where the object wasn't available
        echo "No object returned. Handling null scenario gracefully.\n";
    } else {
        // Proceed with operations on MyObject
        echo "Object received and ready for use.\n";
    }
}

// Example usage of MyObjectProvider
$provider = new MyObjectProvider();
handleMyObject($provider);

?>
```

### Key Points:

1. **Union Types for Return Values:** The `?MyObject` type declaration in the `getMyObject` method indicates that the method can return either an instance of `MyObject` or `null`.

2. **Graceful Null Handling:** Instead of using exceptions for control flow, which would lead to clutter with try-catch blocks everywhere, the code uses a simple if-check to handle the scenario where `null` is returned.

3. **Extensible Design:** If later the logic needs to be expanded to throw specific exceptions for different error scenarios, such flexibility can be easily added without broadening the scope of exceptions unnecessarily.

This approach maintains clarity in the codebase, promotes type safety, and avoids excessive use of exceptions for control flow purposes, adhering to best practices in exception handling.
