**Explanation:**

1. **Nullable Return Type:**  The core solution is to use the nullable return type `?MyObject`. This clearly indicates that the function can return either a `MyObject` instance *or* `null`.  This is available from PHP 7.1 onwards.

2. **Conditional Handling:** The code demonstrates how to check for `null` after calling the function and handle the case where no object is returned. This avoids the need for try-catch blocks and keeps the code clean.

3. **No Null Object Pattern or Exceptions:**  This approach avoids the overhead of creating Null Objects for every type and the complexity of exception handling for normal program flow (like an object not being found).  Null checks are a standard and often more efficient way to deal with potentially missing values.

4. **Clearer Code:**  Using nullable return types makes the code more readable and self-documenting.  Developers understand directly from the function signature that a null return is possible.


This solution directly addresses the problem by providing a correct and concise way to handle potentially missing return values in PHP 7+ without resorting to excessive try-catch blocks or creating unnecessary Null Objects. It adheres to best practices and maintains code clarity.
