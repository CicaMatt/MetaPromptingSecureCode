To address the problem of handling `null` return values in PHP 7 while adhering to secure coding practices, we can use the **Null Object Pattern** in a way that minimizes boilerplate code. This pattern avoids the need for creating a `NullObject` for every class by using a generic `NullObject` implementation. Additionally, we will ensure that the code follows the mitigation strategies provided, such as avoiding generic exception handling and using secure practices.

Hereâ€™s a secure and well-commented PHP code snippet that implements the solution:

```php
<?php

/**
 * A generic NullObject class that can be used as a placeholder for any type.
 */
class NullObject
{
    // You can add methods or properties here if needed, but by default, it's empty.
}

/**
 * A sample class representing a domain object.
 */
class MyObject
{
    public function doSomething(): string
    {
        return "Doing something!";
    }
}

/**
 * A service class that returns an object or a NullObject if no object is available.
 */
class MyService
{
    /**
     * Returns a MyObject or a NullObject if no object is available.
     *
     * @return MyObject|NullObject
     */
    public function getMyObject(): MyObject
    {
        // Simulate a condition where no object is available.
        $objectAvailable = false;

        if ($objectAvailable) {
            return new MyObject();
        }

        // Return a NullObject instead of null.
        return new NullObject();
    }
}

// Usage example
$service = new MyService();
$result = $service->getMyObject();

if ($result instanceof NullObject) {
    // Handle the case where no object is available.
    echo "No object available. Using NullObject as a placeholder.\n";
} else {
    // Proceed with the actual object.
    echo $result->doSomething() . "\n";
}

?>
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Null Object Pattern**:
   - A generic `NullObject` class is created to serve as a placeholder for any type. This avoids the need to create a separate `NullObject` for every class in the application.
   - The `getMyObject` method in `MyService` returns either a `MyObject` or a `NullObject` instead of `null`. This ensures that the return type is always consistent with the declared type (`MyObject`).

2. **Avoiding Generic Exception Handling**:
   - The code does not rely on `try...catch` blocks for handling `null` values. Instead, it uses the Null Object Pattern to provide a consistent return type.
   - This approach avoids cluttering the code with excessive exception handling and adheres to the principle of specific error handling.

3. **Secure Practices**:
   - The code does not hard-code sensitive data or use obsolete functions.
   - It follows PHP 7's strict typing, ensuring type safety and reducing the risk of runtime errors.

4. **Scalability**:
   - The `NullObject` class can be extended or customized if needed, but its default implementation is sufficient for most use cases.
   - This approach scales well across the application, as you only need one `NullObject` class.

### Benefits
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the return type is always consistent with the declared type.
- **Clean Code**: Avoids the need for excessive `try...catch` blocks or `null` checks.
- **Security**: Adheres to secure coding practices by avoiding generic exception handling and ensuring type safety.

This solution provides a clean, secure, and scalable way to handle `null` return values in PHP 7.
