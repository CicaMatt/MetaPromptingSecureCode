To address the issue of handling null returns in methods with defined return types in PHP, you can utilize a combination of known design patterns and careful error handling to ensure compliance with PHP's strict typing without resorting to insecure or inefficient practices.

Below is a code example that addresses the problem statement using PHP 7 return types. It incorporates the Null Object Pattern efficiently without creating a separate Null Object for each class and avoids security vulnerabilities as outlined in the mitigation strategies.

Although not all mitigation strategies are directly applicable to the problem at hand, I've noted potential security concerns where relevant. For example, the code snippet below doesn't directly handle passwords or certificate validation, but care is taken in exception handling:

```php
<?php

// Define an interface for the MyObject type.
interface MyObjectInterface {
    public function performAction();
}

// Define a ConcreteMyObject class that implements the MyObjectInterface.
class ConcreteMyObject implements MyObjectInterface {
    public function performAction() {
        // Implementation for performing actions.
        echo "Action performed by ConcreteMyObject.\n";
    }
}

// Define a NullMyObject class that implements the MyObjectInterface.
// It acts as a Null Object, providing default behavior and ensuring no null is returned.
class NullMyObject implements MyObjectInterface {
    public function performAction() {
        // Minimal behavior or no operation.
        echo "No action performed; this is a NullMyObject.\n";
    }
}

class MyObjectFactory {
    // Method returns a MyObjectInterface, ensuring no null is ever returned.
    public function getMyObject(bool $condition) : MyObjectInterface {
        if ($condition) {
            return new ConcreteMyObject();
        } else {
            return new NullMyObject();
        }
    }
}

// Usage
$factory = new MyObjectFactory();

// Condition is false, so NullMyObject is returned.
$myObject = $factory->getMyObject(false);
$myObject->performAction(); // Outputs: "No action performed; this is a NullMyObject."

// Condition is true, so ConcreteMyObject is returned.
$myObject = $factory->getMyObject(true);
$myObject->performAction(); // Outputs: "Action performed by ConcreteMyObject."

?>
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Null Object Pattern**: This implementation introduces a `NullMyObject` class that safely handles cases when a valid object cannot be provided. This way, you avoid returning null while adhering to strict type declarations.

2. **Interface Usage**: By defining an `MyObjectInterface`, both `ConcreteMyObject` and `NullMyObject` implement this interface, ensuring consistency and type safety.

3. **Factory Pattern**: The `MyObjectFactory` class is used to encapsulate object creation logic, which further ensures that objects created are always consistent with the interface and type expectations.

4. **No Generic Exception Handling**: The approach eliminates the need for try-catch for null returns, thus avoiding generic exception handling, aligning with security practices.

Though the provided solution doesn't directly incorporate certificate handling, password management, or cryptography (since they're outside the given problem's scope), it aligns with best practices by avoiding vulnerable practices such as generic exception handling. You can extend these principles in other parts of the application where those security aspects are relevant.
