```php
<?php

class MyObject {
    public $data;

    public function __construct($data = null) {
        $this->data = $data;
    }
}

class MyClass {

    public function getMyObject(): ?MyObject 
    {
        // Logic to retrieve MyObject...
        if ($someCondition) {
            return new MyObject("Some data");
        } else {
            return null; 
        }
    }


    public function useMyObject() {
        $obj = $this->getMyObject();

        if ($obj !== null) {  // or if ($obj) { ... }
            echo "Object data: " . $obj->data . "\n";
        } else {
            echo "No object returned.\n";
            // Handle the case where no object is returned
        }
    }
}



$myClass = new MyClass();
$myClass->useMyObject();


// Example demonstrating condition where object is returned:
$someCondition = true; // Change to test
if ($someCondition) { 
    $myClass->useMyObject(); // Output: Object data: Some data
} else {
    $myClass->useMyObject(); // Output: No object returned.
}

?>
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Nullable Return Type:** The core issue is addressed by using the nullable return type `?MyObject`.  This explicitly indicates that the function `getMyObject()` can return either an instance of `MyObject` or `null`. This is the standard and recommended way to handle potentially missing return values in PHP 7 and later.

2. **Conditional Handling:** Instead of relying on try-catch blocks, which are not appropriate for regular control flow of potentially missing values, the code uses a simple `if ($obj !== null)` check. This allows for specific handling of the case where no object is available, preventing errors and ensuring the application continues to function correctly.

3. **No Null Object Pattern or Excessive Try-Catch Blocks:** The solution avoids the unnecessary overhead of the Null Object pattern for this simple scenario.  It also eliminates the need for widespread, inappropriate use of try-catch, which would make the code more complex and harder to maintain.


This approach is cleaner, more efficient, and adheres to modern PHP best practices for handling situations where a function might not be able to return the expected object type. It directly addresses the original problem statement's concerns about try-catch overuse and the Null Object pattern.
