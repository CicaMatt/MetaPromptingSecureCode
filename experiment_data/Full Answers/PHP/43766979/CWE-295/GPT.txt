To address your problem statement about database connectivity and exception handling, let's first tackle the PHP code itself for a clearer understanding of handling connection failures appropriately. However, to ensure a broader understanding of how to implement proper certificate validation within this scope, I’ll walk through that first.

### Certificate Validation in PHP

For secure connections using PHP, particularly when connecting to databases over SSL/TLS, it is essential to ensure that the connection is secure:

1. **Use SSL/TLS:** Make sure that SSL/TLS is enabled on your database server and the client library is configured to use it.
2. **Validate Server Certificates:** PHP's `mysqli` and `PDO` extensions have options to validate server certificates to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

Here's an example demonstrating robust database connections with certificate validation using `MySQLi`:

```php
<?php
$hostname = "localhost";
$username = "root1";
$password = "";
$database = "php_thenewboston";
$mysqli = new mysqli();
$mysqli->options(MYSQLI_OPT_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT, true);

$serverCa = '/path/to/ca-cert.pem'; // Path to the CA certificate
$clientCert = '/path/to/client-cert.pem'; // Optional: Path to Client certificate
$clientKey = '/path/to/client-key.pem'; // Optional: Path to Client key

$mysqli->ssl_set($clientKey, $clientCert, $serverCa, NULL, NULL);
$mysqli->real_connect($hostname, $username, $password, $database, 3306, NULL, MYSQLI_CLIENT_SSL);

try {
    if ($mysqli->connect_errno) {
        throw new Exception("Failed to connect to MySQL: " . $mysqli->connect_error, $mysqli->connect_errno);
    } else {
        echo "Connected successfully using SSL.";
    }
} catch (Exception $ex) {
    echo "Error: " . $ex->getMessage();
}

$mysqli->close();
?>
```

### Improvements to Your Existing Code

If you are working in a controlled environment and mainly testing database connectivity, here’s how to enhance the exception handling in your provided code. Ensure proper differentiation between server connection errors and database selection errors:

```php
<?php
$hostname = "localhost";
$username = "root1";
$password = ""; 
$database = "php_thenewboston";

class ServerException extends Exception {}  
class DatabaseException extends Exception {}

try {
    $conn = @mysqli_connect($hostname, $username, $password);

    if (!$conn) {
        throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server: ' . mysqli_connect_error());
    } 

    $conn_db = @mysqli_select_db($conn, $database);

    if (!$conn_db) {
        throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database: ' . mysqli_error($conn));
    }

    echo "Connected successfully to the database.";
} catch (ServerException $ex) {
    echo "Server Error: " . $ex->getMessage();
} catch (DatabaseException $ex) {
    echo "Database Error: " . $ex->getMessage();
}
?>
```

### Key Points:

- **Certificate Paths**: When using SSL parameters, ensure the paths to the certificate files are correct and accessible.
- **Error Handling**: This code distinguishes between server and database connection errors, providing more informative error messages.

Remember to replace the paths to the SSL certificates with the actual paths where your certificate files are stored on the server. This will ensure the validity and authenticity of the server your PHP client connects to, implementing robust certificate validation.
