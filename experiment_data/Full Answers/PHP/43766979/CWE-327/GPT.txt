To address the problem in your PHP code related to database connectivity and exception handling, I'll provide a corrected version of the snippet. The goal is to distinguish between connection issues to the server and issues selecting the database and ensure that the appropriate error message is displayed for each scenario.

Before we get into the code, let's break down the issues:

1. **Connection Issue Handling**:
    - We need to connect to the database server using the correct credentials first and then select the database to use.
    - If the connection to the server fails, a specific exception message should be displayed.
    - If selecting the database fails, another specific exception message should be shown.

Here's a revised version of your PHP code to handle these cases correctly:

```php
<?php
$hostname = "localhost";
$username = "root1";
$password = "";
$database = "php_thenewboston";

class ServerException extends Exception {}
class DatabaseException extends Exception {}

try {
    // Connect to the MySQL server
    $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname, $username, $password);
    
    // Check if the server connection was successful
    if (!$conn) {
        // Throw a server exception if the connection failed
        throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server: ' . mysqli_connect_error());
    }

    // Attempt to select the database
    if (!mysqli_select_db($conn, $database)) {
        // Throw a database exception if the database selection failed
        throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database: ' . mysqli_error($conn));
    }

    // Indicate successful connection
    echo "Connected successfully.";

} catch (ServerException $ex) {
    echo "Error: " . $ex->getMessage();
} catch (DatabaseException $ex) {
    echo "Error: " . $ex->getMessage();
} finally {
    // Close the connection if it was successfully opened
    if ($conn) {
        mysqli_close($conn);
    }
}
?>
```

### Key Changes and Improvements:

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - The code now separates the server connection attempt from the database selection, making it clear where each type of failure occurs.

2. **Error Reporting**:
   - Instead of generic error messages, the code utilizes `mysqli_connect_error()` and `mysqli_error()` to provide specific feedback on what went wrong.

3. **Exception Handling**:
   - Separate exceptions (`ServerException` and `DatabaseException`) are clearly defined and thrown to handle different aspects of the database connection task.

4. **Connection Cleanup**:
   - The code ensures that the connection to the server is closed if it was successfully opened, using a `finally` block.

By applying these changes, the code now correctly handles and reports different types of database connection issues, improving the usability and maintainability of the application.
