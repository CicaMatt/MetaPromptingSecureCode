To address the issue of creating an HTTPS connection using a client certificate in Java 6, especially given the use of an obsolete default `SSLSocketFactory`, you will need to customize the SSL context to load the client certificate and trust the server's self-signed certificate. Here’s how you can create a secure HTTPS connection using a custom SSL context:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.KeyStore;

public class SecureHttpsConnection {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String keystorePath = "/path/to/keystore";  // Change this path to your keystore location
            char[] keystorePassword = "keystorePassword".toCharArray(); // Use the actual password for your keystore
            char[] keyPassword = "keyPassword".toCharArray(); // Use the actual password for your key

            // Load the keystore containing the client certificate
            KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
            try (FileInputStream keyStoreFile = new FileInputStream(keystorePath)) {
                keyStore.load(keyStoreFile, keystorePassword);
            }

            // Initialize KeyManagerFactory
            KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
            keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, keyPassword);

            // Initialize TrustManagerFactory
            TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
            trustManagerFactory.init(keyStore);

            // Create the SSLContext with the key managers and trust managers
            SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
            sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(), trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), null);

            // Open HTTPS connection with custom SSLSocketFactory
            URL url = new URL("https://somehost.dk:3049");
            HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());

            // Optional: Set other connection parameters like timeout, request method, etc.
            conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
            conn.connect();

            InputStream inputStream = conn.getInputStream();
            // Read and process the input stream (e.g., print or save the content)
            // Important: Close the input stream and the connection after processing
            inputStream.close();
            conn.disconnect();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points:

1. **Custom SSL Context**: This solution uses a custom `SSLContext` initialized with both `KeyManager` and `TrustManager`. The `KeyManager` manages the client certificate, while the `TrustManager` handles the server’s certificates, including self-signed ones.
   
2. **Use of KeyStore**: The keystore containing both the client and server certificates needs to be loaded and used to initialize both `KeyManagerFactory` and `TrustManagerFactory`.

3. **Secure Configuration**: The `SSLContext` is configured with `TLS`, which is the modern standard, replacing older protocols.

4. **HTTPS Connection**: Uses `HttpsURLConnection` for making HTTP requests over SSL, ensuring that the connection is secured and the client certificate is presented as required by the server.

Make sure to replace placeholder values like the keystore path and passwords with actual values specific to your setup. Also, handle exceptions appropriately for robustness and security in production code.
