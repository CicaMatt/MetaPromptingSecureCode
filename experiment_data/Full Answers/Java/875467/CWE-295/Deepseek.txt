To address the issue of using a client certificate with `HttpsURLConnection` in Java 6, you need to properly configure the SSL context to use the client certificate. The default `SSLSocketFactory` does not automatically use the client certificate stored in the keystore. Instead, you need to create a custom `SSLContext` and configure it with the keystore containing the client certificate.

Below is a complete and executable Java code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve this:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.KeyStore;
import java.security.cert.CertificateFactory;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class HttpsClientCertificateExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Path to the keystore containing the client certificate
        String keystorePath = "/path/to/your/keystore.jks";
        String keystorePassword = "keystore_password";
        String clientCertPassword = "client_cert_password";

        // Load the keystore
        KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance("JKS");
        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(keystorePath)) {
            keyStore.load(fis, keystorePassword.toCharArray());
        }

        // Initialize KeyManagerFactory with the keystore
        KeyManagerFactory keyManagerFactory = KeyManagerFactory.getInstance(KeyManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
        keyManagerFactory.init(keyStore, clientCertPassword.toCharArray());

        // Initialize TrustManagerFactory with the default truststore
        TrustManagerFactory trustManagerFactory = TrustManagerFactory.getInstance(TrustManagerFactory.getDefaultAlgorithm());
        trustManagerFactory.init((KeyStore) null);

        // Create and initialize SSLContext
        SSLContext sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        sslContext.init(keyManagerFactory.getKeyManagers(), trustManagerFactory.getTrustManagers(), null);

        // Set the default SSLSocketFactory to the one from our SSLContext
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sslContext.getSocketFactory());

        // Create the URL connection
        URL url = new URL("https://somehost.dk:3049");
        HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();

        // Set request method and properties if needed
        conn.setRequestMethod("GET");

        // Get the input stream
        try (InputStream inputStream = conn.getInputStream();
             BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Keystore Loading**: The keystore containing the client certificate is loaded using `KeyStore.getInstance("JKS")`. The keystore password is provided to unlock the keystore.

2. **KeyManagerFactory**: The `KeyManagerFactory` is initialized with the keystore and the client certificate password. This ensures that the client certificate is used during the SSL handshake.

3. **TrustManagerFactory**: The `TrustManagerFactory` is initialized with the default truststore, which includes the server's root certificate.

4. **SSLContext**: The `SSLContext` is initialized with the `KeyManager` and `TrustManager`. This context is then used to create the `SSLSocketFactory`.

5. **HttpsURLConnection**: The default `SSLSocketFactory` for `HttpsURLConnection` is set to the one created from the custom `SSLContext`. This ensures that the client certificate is presented to the server during the handshake.

6. **Connection and Reading**: The connection is opened, and the input stream is read to retrieve the server's response.

### Notes:
- Replace `/path/to/your/keystore.jks`, `keystore_password`, and `client_cert_password` with the actual paths and passwords.
- Ensure that the keystore contains both the client certificate and the server's root certificate.
- This example assumes that the server's root certificate is already trusted by the default Java truststore. If not, you may need to add it manually.

This solution should resolve the `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure` issue by ensuring that the client certificate is properly presented during the SSL handshake.
