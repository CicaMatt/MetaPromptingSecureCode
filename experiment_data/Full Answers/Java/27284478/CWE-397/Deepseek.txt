To address the security concern of passing sensitive information like passwords in a secure manner, we can use a combination of `char[]` and `byte[]` arrays, along with proper cleanup to minimize the risk of sensitive data being exposed in memory dumps. Below is a Java code snippet that demonstrates how to securely handle passwords using `char[]` and `byte[]` arrays, and how to properly clean up the sensitive data after use.

```java
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class SecurePasswordHandling {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Simulate user input for password
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your password: ");
        String password = scanner.nextLine();

        // Convert password to char array
        char[] passChar = password.toCharArray();

        // Convert char array to byte array
        byte[] passByte = toBytes(passChar);

        // Use the password (e.g., for authentication)
        usePassword(passByte);

        // Clean up sensitive data
        clean(passChar);
        clean(passByte);

        System.out.println("Password handling completed securely.");
    }

    private static byte[] toBytes(char[] chars) {
        byte[] bytes = new byte[chars.length * 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            bytes[i * 2] = (byte) (chars[i] >> 8);
            bytes[i * 2 + 1] = (byte) chars[i];
        }
        return bytes;
    }

    private static void usePassword(byte[] password) {
        // Simulate password usage (e.g., hashing, sending over network, etc.)
        // For demonstration, we'll just print the length
        System.out.println("Password length: " + password.length);
    }

    private static void clean(char[] chars) {
        if (chars != null) {
            Arrays.fill(chars, '\0');
        }
    }

    private static void clean(byte[] bytes) {
        if (bytes != null) {
            Arrays.fill(bytes, (byte) 0);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The password is read from the user input and stored in a `String`. This is immediately converted to a `char[]` array to minimize the time the password is stored in a `String` object, which is immutable and can linger in memory.

2. **Conversion to Byte Array**: The `char[]` array is converted to a `byte[]` array. This conversion is done manually to ensure that the password is stored in a mutable format that can be securely cleaned up later.

3. **Usage**: The `usePassword` method simulates the usage of the password (e.g., hashing, sending over the network). In a real-world scenario, this would involve actual cryptographic operations or secure transmission.

4. **Cleanup**: After the password is no longer needed, both the `char[]` and `byte[]` arrays are securely cleaned by overwriting their contents with zeros. This minimizes the risk of the password being exposed in memory dumps.

### Security Considerations:
- **Minimize Exposure**: By converting the password to a `char[]` and then to a `byte[]`, we reduce the time the password is stored in an immutable `String` object.
- **Secure Cleanup**: Overwriting the arrays with zeros ensures that the sensitive data is not left in memory after use.
- **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: The code does not throw generic exceptions, ensuring that specific error handling can be implemented if needed.

This approach provides a more secure way to handle sensitive information like passwords in Java, reducing the risk of exposure through memory dumps.
