To address the issue of encrypting data in MySQL in a way that is compatible with SQL Server, we can use a standardized encryption algorithm that is supported by both databases. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm that is supported by both MySQL and SQL Server. 

In this solution, we will use Java to encrypt and decrypt data using AES-256, ensuring compatibility between MySQL and SQL Server. The key and initialization vector (IV) will be shared between the two systems to ensure that data encrypted in MySQL can be decrypted in SQL Server and vice versa.

### Java Code Snippet

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.IvParameterSpec;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.util.Base64;

public class AESEncryption {

    private static final String ALGORITHM = "AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding";
    private static final String SECRET_KEY = "your-256-bit-secret-key"; // 32 characters for AES-256
    private static final String INIT_VECTOR = "your-16-bit-init-vector"; // 16 characters for AES

    public static String encrypt(String value) {
        try {
            IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(INIT_VECTOR.getBytes("UTF-8"));
            SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(SECRET_KEY.getBytes("UTF-8"), "AES");

            Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
            cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, iv);

            byte[] encrypted = cipher.doFinal(value.getBytes());
            return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encrypted);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        return null;
    }

    public static String decrypt(String encrypted) {
        try {
            IvParameterSpec iv = new IvParameterSpec(INIT_VECTOR.getBytes("UTF-8"));
            SecretKeySpec skeySpec = new SecretKeySpec(SECRET_KEY.getBytes("UTF-8"), "AES");

            Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(ALGORITHM);
            cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, skeySpec, iv);

            byte[] original = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encrypted));
            return new String(original);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String originalString = "SensitiveData";

        System.out.println("Original String: " + originalString);

        String encryptedString = encrypt(originalString);
        System.out.println("Encrypted String: " + encryptedString);

        String decryptedString = decrypt(encryptedString);
        System.out.println("Decrypted String: " + decryptedString);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Algorithm**: We use AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS5 padding (`AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding`), which is a standard and secure encryption method.
2. **Secret Key**: The secret key is 32 characters long (256 bits) for AES-256 encryption.
3. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: The IV is 16 characters long (128 bits) and is used to ensure that the same plaintext encrypted with the same key produces different ciphertexts.
4. **Base64 Encoding**: The encrypted data is encoded in Base64 to ensure it can be safely stored and transmitted as a string.

### Steps to Use:
1. **Encrypt Data in MySQL**: Use the `encrypt` method to encrypt data in MySQL before storing it in the database.
2. **Decrypt Data in SQL Server**: Use the `decrypt` method to decrypt data in SQL Server after retrieving it from the database.

### Important Notes:
- Ensure that the `SECRET_KEY` and `INIT_VECTOR` are securely stored and shared between the systems.
- The same key and IV must be used for both encryption and decryption to ensure compatibility.
- This solution assumes that the encryption and decryption logic is implemented in Java. If you need to implement this in SQL Server or MySQL directly, you would need to use their respective encryption functions with the same key and IV.

This approach ensures that data encrypted in MySQL can be decrypted in SQL Server, maintaining compatibility and security across both systems.
