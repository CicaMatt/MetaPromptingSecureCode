To address the issue of encrypting data in MySQL in a way that is compatible with SQL Server, we can use a standardized encryption algorithm like AES-256. Both MySQL and SQL Server support AES-256 encryption, but the key is to ensure that the encryption and decryption processes are implemented in a way that is compatible across both databases.

Below is a Java code snippet that demonstrates how to encrypt and decrypt data using AES-256 in a way that should be compatible with both MySQL and SQL Server. This example uses the `javax.crypto` package for encryption and decryption.

```java
import javax.crypto.Cipher;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.util.Base64;

public class AES256CompatibleEncryption {

    private static final String ALGORITHM = "AES";
    private static final String TRANSFORMATION = "AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding"; // ECB mode is used for simplicity, but consider using CBC or GCM for better security

    public static String encrypt(String data, String key) throws Exception {
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), ALGORITHM);
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);
        cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
        byte[] encryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(data.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
        return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes);
    }

    public static String decrypt(String encryptedData, String key) throws Exception {
        SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8), ALGORITHM);
        Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(TRANSFORMATION);
        cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
        byte[] decryptedBytes = cipher.doFinal(Base64.getDecoder().decode(encryptedData));
        return new String(decryptedBytes, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String key = "12345678901234567890123456789012"; // 32 bytes key for AES-256
            String originalData = "SensitiveData";

            // Encrypt the data
            String encryptedData = encrypt(originalData, key);
            System.out.println("Encrypted Data: " + encryptedData);

            // Decrypt the data
            String decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, key);
            System.out.println("Decrypted Data: " + decryptedData);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Key**: The key used for AES-256 encryption must be 32 bytes long. In this example, the key is `"12345678901234567890123456789012"`.
2. **Encryption**: The `encrypt` method takes the plaintext data and the key, encrypts the data using AES-256, and returns the encrypted data as a Base64-encoded string.
3. **Decryption**: The `decrypt` method takes the Base64-encoded encrypted data and the key, decrypts the data, and returns the original plaintext.
4. **Compatibility**: The use of AES-256 with ECB mode and PKCS5 padding ensures compatibility between MySQL and SQL Server. However, ECB mode is not recommended for most use cases due to its lack of security. Consider using CBC or GCM mode with an initialization vector (IV) for better security.

### Important Notes:
- **Security**: ECB mode is used here for simplicity, but it is not secure for most real-world applications. Consider using CBC or GCM mode with an IV for better security.
- **Key Management**: Ensure that the encryption key is securely stored and managed. Hardcoding the key in the code is not recommended for production environments.
- **Database Compatibility**: Both MySQL and SQL Server support AES encryption, but you may need to adjust the encryption settings (e.g., padding, mode) to ensure full compatibility.

This code should help you encrypt and decrypt data in a way that is compatible with both MySQL and SQL Server.
