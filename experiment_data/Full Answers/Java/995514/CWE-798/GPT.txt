Here's a Java code snippet that demonstrates how to solve the problem of handling HTTPS connections with SSL exceptions due to untrusted server certificates. This solution outlines implementing a custom `X509TrustManager` to temporarily trust all certificates, which can be helpful during development. However, it's essential to stress that trusting all certificates is insecure for production environments and should only be used for debugging purposes. A proper solution would involve configuring your trust store with the correct certificates.

For a more secure implementation, consider installing the server's certificate into your Java truststore. For demonstration purposes, here's a code snippet that bypasses SSL validation:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.security.cert.CertificateException;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.net.URL;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;

public class HttpClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Trust all certificates
            TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
                new X509TrustManager() {
                    public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                        return null;
                    }
                    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) throws CertificateException {
                    }
                    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) throws CertificateException {
                    }
                }
            };

            // Initialize the SSL context
            SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
            sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new SecureRandom());
            HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

            // Create a URL and open a connection
            URL url = new URL("https://yourserver.com/yourEndpoint");
            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

            // Set up the connection properties
            connection.setRequestMethod("POST");
            connection.setDoOutput(true);
            connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json"); // Set the appropriate content type

            // Send the request data
            try (OutputStream os = connection.getOutputStream()) {
                byte[] input = "{\"key\":\"value\"}".getBytes("utf-8");
                os.write(input, 0, input.length);
            }

            // Get the response code
            int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
            System.out.println("Response Code: " + responseCode);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Important Notes:
- **Security Warning**: Trusting all certifications as shown, bypasses SSL/TLS validation and is insecure. This should never be used in a production environment. Instead, configure your application to use a proper trust store that includes the server's certificate or a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) in the chain of trust.
- **Java Truststore Configuration**: For production, you should import the server's public certificate into your Java keystore. Use the `keytool` command-line utility to manage certificates in the keystore.
- **Error Handling**: The above code assumes that the server response will be managed correctly elsewhere. Adapt error handling and responses based on your application needs.
