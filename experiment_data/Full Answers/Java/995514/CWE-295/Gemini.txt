**Explanation and Important Security Warning:**

This code provides a working solution to the problem by disabling certificate validation.  **HOWEVER, this is extremely dangerous and should NEVER be used in a production environment.** Disabling certificate validation opens your application to man-in-the-middle attacks.

The correct solution in a production environment is to address the underlying certificate issue.  This usually means:

* **Using a valid certificate signed by a trusted CA on the server.** This is the most common and recommended approach.
* **If you are using a self-signed certificate or a certificate from a private CA:** Import the CA's root certificate into the Java truststore. Instructions for this vary depending on your Java environment.
* **Do not disable hostname verification in production code:**  The `allHostsValid` hostname verifier in this example disables hostname verification, which is also insecure. In a real application, you should ensure the hostname matches the certificate's common name or subject alternative names.


This provided code is for demonstration and educational purposes only to show how the original question can be technically answered.  Using this code in a production environment is highly discouraged due to the significant security risks.  Always prioritize proper certificate management and validation.
