To access the list of trusted root certificates that are implicitly trusted by the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in a Java application, you can utilize the JRE's built-in trust store, typically located in the `lib/security/cacerts` file of your JRE installation.

Here's a Java code snippet that helps you programmatically retrieve and print out all the trusted root certificates stored in this trust store:

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.security.KeyStore;
import java.security.cert.Certificate;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;
import java.util.Enumeration;

public class TrustedRootCertificates {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Load the default system trust store
            String javaHome = System.getProperty("java.home");
            String trustStorePath = javaHome + "/lib/security/cacerts";
            FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(trustStorePath);

            KeyStore trustStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());
            char[] password = "changeit".toCharArray(); // Default password for the JRE cacerts keystore
            trustStore.load(is, password);

            Enumeration<String> aliases = trustStore.aliases();
            while (aliases.hasMoreElements()) {
                String alias = aliases.nextElement();
                Certificate cert = trustStore.getCertificate(alias);

                if (cert instanceof X509Certificate) {
                    X509Certificate x509cert = (X509Certificate) cert;
                    System.out.println("Certificate Subject: " + x509cert.getSubjectDN());
                    System.out.println("Certificate Issuer: " + x509cert.getIssuerDN());
                    System.out.println();
                }
            }

            is.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Path to Trust Store**: The code fetches the path to the JRE's default trust store (`cacerts`). Ensure that this path points to the correct location where `cacerts` resides, which is generally at `lib/security/cacerts` within the JRE folder.
- **Keystore Password**: The default password for the JRE trust store is "changeit". If your environment uses a different password, be sure to replace it.
- **Keystore Type**: The default keystore type is used, typically `JKS`.
- **Output**: The program enumerates all aliases in the trust store and retrieves certificates, printing out the subject and issuer details of each X.509 certificate.

Remember:
- Regularly update your JRE to ensure you have the latest set of root certificates.
- If managing custom certificates, consider maintaining them in a separate keystore and merging custom trust with the system trust programmatically as needed.

This approach will allow you to retrieve and review root certificates trusted by your JRE reliably.
