The issue you're encountering is related to SSL/TLS certificate validation. The server you're trying to connect to is using a certificate that is not trusted by the Java runtime environment (JRE) on your machine. This is a security feature to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

However, if you are in a controlled environment and understand the risks, you can bypass this validation by implementing a custom `TrustManager` that trusts all certificates. **Note:** This is not recommended for production environments as it compromises security.

Below is a Java code snippet that demonstrates how to bypass SSL certificate validation:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class SSLHandshakeBypass {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
            new X509TrustManager() {
                public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                    return new X509Certificate[0];
                }
                public void checkClientTrusted(
                    java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
                public void checkServerTrusted(
                    java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
            }
        };

        // Install the all-trusting trust manager
        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

        // Create all-trusting host name verifier
        HostnameVerifier allHostsValid = (hostname, session) -> true;

        // Install the all-trusting host verifier
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(allHostsValid);

        // Now you can make your request
        URL url = new URL("https://www.abc.com");
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
        conn.setDoOutput(true);

        DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());
        wr.flush();
        wr.close();

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **TrustManager**: A custom `TrustManager` is created that trusts all certificates.
2. **SSLContext**: The `SSLContext` is initialized with the custom `TrustManager`.
3. **HostnameVerifier**: A custom `HostnameVerifier` is created that trusts all hostnames.
4. **Connection Setup**: The default `SSLSocketFactory` and `HostnameVerifier` are set to use the custom implementations.
5. **HTTP Request**: The HTTP request is made as usual, but now it will bypass SSL certificate validation.

### Important Notes:
- **Security Risk**: This approach disables SSL certificate validation, which makes your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Use this only in controlled environments where you fully understand the risks.
- **Production Environment**: In a production environment, you should always ensure that the server's SSL certificate is valid and trusted. If the server's certificate is not trusted, you should contact the server administrator to resolve the issue.

This solution should help you bypass the SSL handshake exception, but it is crucial to understand the security implications of doing so.
