The exception you're encountering, `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException`, indicates that the Java application is unable to establish a secure connection to the server because it cannot validate the server's SSL certificate. This is often due to the server's certificate not being trusted by the Java runtime environment (JRE).

To mitigate this issue, you have a few options:

1. **Add the Server's Certificate to the JRE's Truststore**: This is the most secure approach, but it requires access to the server's certificate and administrative privileges to modify the JRE's truststore.

2. **Bypass SSL Certificate Validation**: This is a less secure approach and should only be used in development or testing environments. It involves creating a custom `TrustManager` that trusts all certificates.

Below is a **secure and modern alternative** that uses the `HttpsURLConnection` class with a custom `TrustManager` to bypass SSL certificate validation. This solution should only be used in controlled environments where security risks are understood and accepted.

### Complete and Executable Java Code Snippet

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class SecureHttpClient {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
            new X509TrustManager() {
                public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                    return new X509Certificate[0];
                }
                public void checkClientTrusted(
                    java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
                public void checkServerTrusted(
                    java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
            }
        };

        // Install the all-trusting trust manager
        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

        // Create all-trusting host name verifier
        HostnameVerifier allHostsValid = (hostname, session) -> true;

        // Install the all-trusting host verifier
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(allHostsValid);

        // Your original code with minor adjustments
        URL url = new URL("https://www.abc.com");
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

        conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
        conn.setDoOutput(true);

        DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());
        // wr.writeBytes(params); // Uncomment and replace with actual parameters if needed
        wr.flush();
        wr.close();

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Custom TrustManager**: The `X509TrustManager` implementation is overridden to trust all certificates, effectively bypassing SSL certificate validation.
2. **SSLContext Initialization**: The `SSLContext` is initialized with the custom `TrustManager`.
3. **Hostname Verification**: A custom `HostnameVerifier` is created to trust all hostnames.
4. **Connection Setup**: The `HttpsURLConnection` is configured to use the custom `SSLSocketFactory` and `HostnameVerifier`.

### Important Note:
- **Security Risk**: This solution bypasses SSL certificate validation, which is a significant security risk. It should only be used in environments where the security implications are fully understood and accepted.
- **Production Environment**: In a production environment, you should always validate SSL certificates to ensure secure communication.

This code snippet provides a quick fix for development or testing purposes. For production, consider adding the server's certificate to the JRE's truststore or using a trusted certificate authority (CA) to issue the server's certificate.
