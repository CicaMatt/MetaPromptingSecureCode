To address the issue of improper certificate validation in Java, you can use a custom `TrustManager` to bypass SSL certificate validation. However, this approach is **not recommended for production environments** as it exposes your application to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. It should only be used for testing or development purposes.

Below is a Java code snippet that demonstrates how to bypass SSL certificate validation using a custom `TrustManager`:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class SSLValidationBypass {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a trust manager that does not validate certificate chains
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
            new X509TrustManager() {
                public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                    return new X509Certificate[0];
                }
                public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
                public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                }
            }
        };

        // Install the all-trusting trust manager
        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

        // Create all-trusting host name verifier
        HostnameVerifier allHostsValid = new HostnameVerifier() {
            public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
                return true;
            }
        };

        // Install the all-trusting host verifier
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultHostnameVerifier(allHostsValid);

        // Now you can make the request
        URL url = new URL("https://www.abc.com");
        HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
        conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
        conn.setDoOutput(true);

        DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());
        wr.flush();
        wr.close();

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(line);
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Custom TrustManager**: 
   - The `X509TrustManager` implementation is overridden to bypass certificate validation. This means it will trust any certificate presented by the server.

2. **SSLContext Initialization**:
   - The `SSLContext` is initialized with the custom `TrustManager` and a secure random number generator.

3. **HostnameVerifier**:
   - A custom `HostnameVerifier` is implemented to bypass hostname verification. This means it will accept any hostname.

4. **Making the Request**:
   - The code then proceeds to make the HTTPS request as usual, but now it will not throw an exception due to invalid certificates.

### Important Note:
- **Security Risk**: This solution disables SSL certificate validation, which makes your application vulnerable to MITM attacks. It should only be used in controlled environments where the risk is understood and accepted.
- **Production Use**: For production environments, always ensure that proper certificate validation is in place. Use trusted certificates issued by a recognized Certificate Authority (CA) and implement certificate pinning if necessary.

### Recommended Approach:
If you have control over the server, ensure that it uses a valid SSL certificate issued by a trusted CA. If you don't have control over the server, consider reaching out to the server administrator to resolve the certificate issue.
