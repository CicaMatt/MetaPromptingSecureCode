**Explanation and Important Security Considerations:**

This code disables certificate and hostname verification.  **This is extremely dangerous and should *never* be used in production code that handles sensitive data.**  This solution is only acceptable for testing against development or internal servers with self-signed certificates where proper certificate validation is not possible or practical.

By disabling these checks, you are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker can intercept and potentially modify the communication.  Always use properly signed and validated certificates in production environments.  Consider using a local truststore if you need to trust a self-signed certificate for legitimate reasons.

This revised solution removes the `setDoOutput(true)` and the `DataOutputStream` since they are unnecessary for a GET request and were contributing to the original error.  It focuses solely on addressing the certificate validation issue for testing purposes.  Remember to revert to proper certificate validation for any production-level code.  This solution directly answers the question of "ignoring" the exception, but emphasizes the security risks involved.  This solution avoids hardcoding credentials directly; the problem was related to SSL certificate handling, not credential storage itself.  The initial description of credential handling best practices remains relevant for overall security.
