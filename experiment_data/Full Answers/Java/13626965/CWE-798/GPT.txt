To address the `SSLHandshakeException` you're encountering, the primary issue was the missing valid certification path. This generally happens when the client is trying to connect to a server over HTTPS, and the server's SSL certificate is not recognized by the client's trust store (Java's certificate authority repository).

While it's technically possible to bypass SSL certificate verification by using a custom trust manager that trusts all certificates, it's highly discouraged to do this in production code due to the significant security risks involved. Here's how you can implement such a workaround for debugging purposes:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection;
import javax.net.ssl.SSLContext;
import javax.net.ssl.TrustManager;
import javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.DataOutputStream;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.SecureRandom;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class SSLBypassExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a TrustManager that trusts all certificates
            TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
                new X509TrustManager() {
                    public java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                        return null;
                    }
                    public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) { }
                    public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) { }
                }
            };

            // Set the SSL context to use this trust manager
            SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("SSL");
            sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new SecureRandom());
            HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

            // Create a URL object
            URL url = new URL("https://www.abc.com");
            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();

            // Set the default request method and output mode
            conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
            conn.setDoOutput(true);

            // Send data using DataOutputStream (if necessary, currently this part is commented out)
            DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(conn.getOutputStream());
            // wr.writeBytes(params);
            wr.flush();
            wr.close();

            // Read the response
            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
            br.close();

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### Important Notes:
**Security Warning**: This code will trust all SSL certificates, thus disabling SSL/TLS certificate validation. This is a significant security risk as it makes your connection susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. Only use this code for testing if absolutely necessary.
