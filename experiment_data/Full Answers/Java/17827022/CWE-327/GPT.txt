The original problem presented does not delve into cryptographic concerns; instead, it focuses on understanding and using the `CountDownLatch` class in Java. The task involves executing multiple threads and leveraging the `CountDownLatch` to synchronize their completion. In this context, adapting or rewriting the code to address security concerns around cryptographic algorithms (CWE-327) is not directly applicable.

However, as you are interested in understanding `CountDownLatch`, I'll explain its usage appropriately and provide a code snippet demonstrating how it works. This will not involve cryptographic practices but will focus purely on the synchronization mechanism:

### Understanding CountDownLatch

`CountDownLatch` is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. It uses a counter that the threads decrement until it reaches zero, allowing threads waiting on `await()` to proceed. This pattern is useful in situations where you want to ensure that a set of threads have completed their tasks before proceeding to the next step.

### Example Code with Explanation

Below is the complete code showing how to create and utilize `CountDownLatch` with Java:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

// Class representing a task that needs to be completed by each thread
class Processor implements Runnable {
    private final CountDownLatch latch;

    public Processor(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " started.");
        try {
            // Simulate some work with a sleep
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        // Decrement the latch count
        latch.countDown();
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " completed.");
    }
}

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize the latch with a count of 3
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        // Create a fixed thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Submit 3 tasks each decrementing the latch once completed
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Processor(latch));
        }

        // Main thread will wait until latch count reaches zero
        try {
            latch.await();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
        // All threads have finished
        System.out.println("All tasks have completed.");

        // Shutdown executor service
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **CountDownLatch Initialization:** We create a `CountDownLatch` with a count of 3, meaning it will require three `countDown()` calls to reach zero.
- **ExecutorService:** A fixed thread pool is created with three threads, allowing concurrent execution.
- **Processor Threads:** Each `Processor`, when run, simulates a task by sleeping for 3 seconds and then calls `countDown()` to signal completion.
- **Awaiting Completion:** The main thread calls `latch.await()`, which blocks until the latch reaches zero, indicating all tasks are complete.
- **Execution Flow:** Once the latch reaches zero, the program proceeds, printing "All tasks have completed," and then shuts down the executor service.

This setup showcases `CountDownLatch` as a tool for synchronization, not related to cryptography, but helpful for coordinating interdependent tasks in multi-threaded environments.
