The problem statement you provided is about understanding and using `CountDownLatch` in Java, not directly related to cryptographic algorithms. However, I will address your question about `CountDownLatch` and provide a solution in Java.

### Understanding `CountDownLatch`

`CountDownLatch` is a synchronization aid that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. It is initialized with a count, and the `await()` method blocks until the count reaches zero due to invocations of the `countDown()` method.

### When to Use `CountDownLatch`

- **Coordination of Tasks**: When you need to ensure that certain tasks are completed before proceeding.
- **Parallel Processing**: When you want to wait for multiple threads to finish their work before continuing.
- **Testing**: In unit tests to ensure that all threads have completed their tasks before asserting results.

### Solution Code

Here is the complete and executable Java code that demonstrates the use of `CountDownLatch`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Processor implements Runnable {
    private CountDownLatch latch;

    public Processor(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Started.");

        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000); // Simulate some work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        latch.countDown(); // Decrement the latch count
        System.out.println("Latch count: " + latch.getCount());
    }
}

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // Initialize with count 3

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // Create a thread pool with 3 threads

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Processor(latch)); // Submit tasks to the executor
        }

        try {
            latch.await(); // Wait until the latch count reaches zero
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Completed.");
        executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the executor
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: The `CountDownLatch` is initialized with a count of 3.
2. **Thread Pool**: An `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool of 3 threads is created.
3. **Task Submission**: Three tasks (instances of `Processor`) are submitted to the executor. Each task simulates some work by sleeping for 3 seconds and then decrements the latch count.
4. **Awaiting Completion**: The main thread waits for the latch count to reach zero using `latch.await()`.
5. **Completion**: Once the latch count reaches zero, the main thread prints "Completed" and shuts down the executor.

This code ensures that the "Completed" message is printed only after all three threads have finished their work and decremented the latch count to zero.
