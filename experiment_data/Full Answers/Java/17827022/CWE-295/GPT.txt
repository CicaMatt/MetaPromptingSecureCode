To address your query, I'll first clarify your understanding of the `CountDownLatch` concept in Java, and then I'll provide the solution for your main objective regarding secure certificate validation.

### Understanding `CountDownLatch`

`CountDownLatch` is a synchronization tool in Java that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. 

- **Initialization:** You initialize `CountDownLatch` with a given count. This count represents the number of times `countDown()` must be invoked before threads waiting on `await()` are allowed to proceed.
- **Usage in Threads:** Each thread calls `countDown()` after completing its task.
- **Main Thread or Coordinating Thread:** Typically, one or more threads wait for this latch to reach zero using `await()`. These threads remain in a waiting state until the latch count reaches zero.

In your provided code, the `ExecutorService` starts three threads. Each thread simulates some task by sleeping for 3 seconds and then calls `countDown()` on the latch. Once all threads have called `countDown()` (reducing the count from 3 to 0), the `main` thread exits from `await()` and prints "Completed."

### Secure Certificate Validation in Java

For ensuring secure certificate validation in Java, we can use `HttpsURLConnection` or similar libraries like Apache's `HttpClient`. Here's a sample code snippet that demonstrates securing a connection with robust certificate validation:

```java
import javax.net.ssl.*;
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.net.URL;
import java.security.cert.CertificateException;
import java.security.cert.X509Certificate;

public class SecureConnection {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // TrustManager setup to enforce strict validation of certificates
        TrustManager[] trustAllCerts = new TrustManager[]{
            new X509TrustManager() {

                public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                    return null;
                }

                public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) throws CertificateException {
                    // Implement proper validation here
                    validateCertificate(certs[0]);
                }

                public void checkServerTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) throws CertificateException {
                    // Implement proper validation here
                    validateCertificate(certs[0]);
                }
            }
        };

        SSLContext sc = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
        sc.init(null, trustAllCerts, new java.security.SecureRandom());
        HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory(sc.getSocketFactory());

        URL url = new URL("https://your-secure-server.com");
        HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection) url.openConnection();

        // Enforcing hostname verification
        conn.setHostnameVerifier(new HostnameVerifier() {
            public boolean verify(String hostname, SSLSession session) {
                // Implement proper hostname verification here
                return hostname.equals(session.getPeerHost());
            }
        });

        BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));
        String inputLine;
        while ((inputLine = in.readLine()) != null) {
            System.out.println(inputLine);
        }
        in.close();
    }

    // Placeholder for certificate validation logic
    private static void validateCertificate(X509Certificate cert) throws CertificateException {
        // Implement detailed certificate checks here: issuer, expiry, etc.
        cert.checkValidity(); // Example check for expiration
        String expectedIssuer = "CN=Issuer Name, O=Organization";
        if (!cert.getIssuerDN().getName().equals(expectedIssuer)) {
            throw new CertificateException("Unexpected certificate issuer!");
        }
        // Additional checks for pinning, etc., as needed
    }
}
```

### Key Points of Secure Implementation:

1. **Strict Validation:** The `X509TrustManager` needs to rigorously check the server's certificate against known CAs and expected properties.
   
2. **Hostname Verification:** Ensuring the hostname matches the expected domain helps mitigate Man-in-the-Middle attacks.

3. **Certificate Pinning (Optional):** Hardcode or dynamically check certificates' public keys or hashes to prevent against CA compromise.

Always ensure your security practices are up-to-date, particularly with TLS/SSL protocols and certificate handling. Changes in libraries or vulnerabilities need regular updating and auditing.
