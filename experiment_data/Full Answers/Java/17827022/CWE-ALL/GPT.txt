The given problem involves understanding the use of `CountDownLatch` in Java, which is a concurrency utility that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes. Below, I provide the revised code snippet implementing the use of `CountDownLatch`, addressing the specific code vulnerabilities mentioned in your mitigation strategies where applicable:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

// Processor class implements Runnable to be executed by a thread
class Processor implements Runnable {
    private final CountDownLatch latch;

    public Processor(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Started.");

        try {
            // Simulate some work with sleep
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Reset the interrupt status
            // Handle interrupted exception specifically
            System.err.println("Thread was interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        }

        latch.countDown();
        System.out.println("Finished.");
    }
}

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initialize CountDownLatch to 3 because we have 3 threads
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        // Executor service to manage a pool of threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Processor(latch));
        }

        try {
            latch.await();  // Wait until the latch has counted down to 0
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt(); // Reset the interrupt status
            // Handle interrupted exception specifically
            System.err.println("Main thread was interrupted: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            executor.shutdown(); // Ensure the executor service is properly shut down
        }

        System.out.println("Completed.");
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Exception Handling (CWE-397)**:
   - Specific handling for the `InterruptedException` is done, capturing it in a catch block and resetting the interrupt status using `Thread.currentThread().interrupt()`. This ensures that interruptions are not silently ignored.

2. **Proper Resource Management**:
   - The `ExecutorService` is shut down gracefully using `executor.shutdown()`, ensuring that all threads terminate properly and resources are not leaked.

3. **Readable and Maintainable Code**:
   - Clear console messages have been added to trace the flow of, and wait on, the countdown latch.

Note: Since the example does not involve aspects like password management, certificate handling, cryptographic algorithms, or deprecated functions, those mitigation strategies are not applicable here. However, the pattern of exception handling and resource management showcases secure practices in the given code snippet.
