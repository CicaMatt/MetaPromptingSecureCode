To address your requirement of mitigating hard-coded passwords in your web scraping task with Scrapy and Selenium, it's essential to refactor your code to securely handle credentials. Instead of embedding usernames and passwords directly into your code, you should use environment variables or a configuration file.

Here's a revised version of your script that reads credentials from environment variables and securely logs in to a website using Scrapy and Selenium:

```python
import os
from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy.http import FormRequest, Request
from selenium import webdriver

# Make sure to set the following environment variables in your shell or IDE.
# export WEBSITE_USERNAME="your_username"
# export WEBSITE_PASSWORD="your_password"
username = os.getenv('WEBSITE_USERNAME')
password = os.getenv('WEBSITE_PASSWORD')

if not username or not password:
    raise EnvironmentError("Please set the WEBSITE_USERNAME and WEBSITE_PASSWORD environment variables")

class MySpider(Spider):
    name = 'MySpider'
    start_urls = ['http://my_domain.com/']

    def get_cookies(self):
        driver = webdriver.Firefox()
        driver.implicitly_wait(30)
        base_url = "http://www.my_domain.com/"
        driver.get(base_url)
        driver.find_element_by_name("USER").clear()
        driver.find_element_by_name("USER").send_keys(username)
        driver.find_element_by_name("PASSWORD").clear()
        driver.find_element_by_name("PASSWORD").send_keys(password)
        driver.find_element_by_name("submit").click()
        
        cookies = driver.get_cookies()
        driver.quit()
        return {cookie['name']: cookie['value'] for cookie in cookies}

    def parse(self, response):
        # Fetch cookies using Selenium and store them
        my_cookies = self.get_cookies()
        
        # Create a new request with the cookies
        return Request(
            url="http://my_domain.com/",
            cookies=my_cookies,
            callback=self.after_login
        )

    def after_login(self, response):
        # For demonstration, printing the title of the page
        print("Logged in:", response.css('title::text').get())

```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Credentials are read from environment variables, avoiding hard-coded secrets.
   
2. **Cookie Management:**
   - The function `get_cookies` collects cookies using Selenium. The returned cookies are used to create a new `Request` object in Scrapy with `scrapy.Request()`.

3. **Exiting Selenium:**
   - Proper closure of the Selenium WebDriver using `driver.quit()` is added to release system resources.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - Before running your code, ensure that `WEBSITE_USERNAME` and `WEBSITE_PASSWORD` are set in your environment to protect sensitive information.

5. **Exception Handling:**
   - The script checks if the environment variables are set; otherwise, it raises an error. 

### Usage:
- Set the required environment variables in your shell session before running the script.
- Ensure that you have the necessary Selenium and Scrapy dependencies installed, along with the appropriate WebDriver for your browser.

This pattern helps maintain security and fosters good practices when working with sensitive data like login credentials.
