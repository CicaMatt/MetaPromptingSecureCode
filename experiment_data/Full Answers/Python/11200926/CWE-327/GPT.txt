To address the original problem of logging into a website using Scrapy and Selenium without insecure cryptographic practices, first, let's ensure you have a consistent workflow for session handling and avoid redundant or outdated methods.

Here is an updated, more reliable solution using Scrapy and Selenium:

```python
from scrapy.spiders import Spider
from scrapy.http import Request
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
import time

class MySpider(Spider):
    name = 'my_spider'
    start_urls = ['http://my_domain.com/']
    
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.driver = webdriver.Firefox()
        super(MySpider, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def start_requests(self):
        # Using Selenium to log in and fetch the cookies
        self.driver.get("http://www.my_domain.com/")
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "USER").send_keys("my_username")
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "PASSWORD").send_keys("my_password")
        self.driver.find_element(By.NAME, "submit").click()
        
        # Wait for the page to load and check for changes
        time.sleep(3)  # Better to use explicit waits in a real scenario

        # Gather cookies from Selenium
        selenium_cookies = self.driver.get_cookies()
        
        # Transform cookies into the format needed by Scrapy
        scrapy_cookies = {cookie['name']: cookie['value'] for cookie in selenium_cookies}
        
        # Close Selenium driver
        self.driver.quit()

        # Start the Scrapy request with cookies
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url=url, cookies=scrapy_cookies, callback=self.parse)

    def parse(self, response):
        # Logic after logging in: parse response
        title = response.xpath('//title/text()').get()
        self.logger.info(f"Logged in page title is: {title}")
        
        # Continue with more parsing or returning items
        # Example:
        # item = MyItem()
        # item['title'] = title
        # yield item
```

### Explanation

1. **Use Reliable Libraries**: We utilize the Selenium browser automation framework to handle JavaScript-heavy login processes. Scrapy then continues with its efficient web crawling capabilities using the cookies obtained by Selenium.

2. **Secure Cookie Handling**: Selenium is used to log in and the resultant cookies are transferred to Scrapy correctly formatted as a dictionary, ensuring seamless session continuity.

3. **Structural Improvements**: 
   - Selenium's `webdriver` handles JavaScript and dynamic content effectively.
   - Uses improved cookie handling, ensuring compatibility with Scrapy requests.

4. **Robustness**: 
   - Include waiting times or conditions to ensure page load and element discovery are handled safely.
   - Running the Scrapy spider ensures efficient and scalable data extraction once logged in successfully.

This approach allows us harmonize Scrapy's powerful scraping abilities with Selenium's dynamic content handling, without relying on insecure or deprecated cryptographic practices.
