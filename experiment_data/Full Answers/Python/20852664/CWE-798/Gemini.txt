**Key Changes & Explanations:**

1. **Key Storage:** The code now retrieves the encryption key from the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable.  This is crucial for security, as it keeps the key separate from the codebase. Instructions are provided to generate a key and store it securely if needed. NEVER hardcode the key directly in the code.

2. **Binary File Handling:** The code now consistently uses binary mode (`'rb'` and `'wb'`) for file operations. This ensures that the encrypted data (which is binary) is handled correctly, avoiding encoding/decoding issues.

3. **Base64 Encoding:** The ciphertext is Base64 encoded before being written to the file.  This makes it safer to handle the ciphertext as text (e.g., storing in a text file or database) and avoids issues with special characters. The `decrypt()` function correspondingly decodes the Base64 before decryption.


4. **Padding Correction (Minor):** The padding functions in both `encrypt` and `decrypt` now use bytes consistently, preventing the `TypeError` and `ValueError` you were encountering.

5. **Decryption Verification:** Added a simple check to verify that the file was decrypted correctly.


This improved solution addresses the original issues and provides a much more secure approach to encryption and decryption by storing the key externally and handling binary data correctly.
