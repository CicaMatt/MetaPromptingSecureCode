To address the problem of broken or risky cryptographic algorithm use, I'll focus on fixing the `decrypt_file` function that fails due to Type errors and incorrect handling of ciphertext. First, let's understand some core issues present in the original code:

1. **String and Byte Conversion:** The error was caused by incorrect handling of bytes and strings, primarily because after reading from the file, the operation attempted to handle read data without proper encoding/decoding.

2. **Padding Issues:** There's unnecessary handling of padding in the `decrypt_file` function. When encrypting, padding ensures the data blocks are aligned correctly. However, during decryption, the padding should be handled differently, as done in the `decrypt` function.

3. **Reading and Writing Binary Data:** The encryption process produces binary data, so when storing that data in a file, we should handle it as binary.

By addressing these issues, we can ensure that the code uses cryptography securely. Here's the revised code:

```python
from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
import base64

def encrypt(message, key=None, key_size=256):
    def pad(s):
        x = AES.block_size - len(s) % AES.block_size
        return s + ((bytes([x])) * x)

    padded_message = pad(message)

    if key is None:
        key = Random.new().read(key_size // 8)

    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

    return iv + cipher.encrypt(padded_message)

def decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    unpad = lambda s: s[:-s[-1]]
    iv = ciphertext[:AES.block_size]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    plaintext = cipher.decrypt(ciphertext[AES.block_size:])
    return unpad(plaintext)

def encrypt_file(file_name, key):
    with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:
        plaintext = f.read()
    enc = encrypt(plaintext, key)
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(enc)

def decrypt_file(file_name, key):
    with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:
        ciphertext = f.read()
    dec = decrypt(ciphertext, key)
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(dec)

key = b'\xbf\xc0\x85)\x10nc\x94\x02)j\xdf\xcb\xc4\x94\x9d(\x9e[EX\xc8\xd5\xbfI{\xa2$\x05(\xd5\x18'

# To test the encryption and decryption
encrypt_file('to_enc.txt', key)
decrypt_file('to_enc.txt', key)
```

### Key Changes:

- **Binary File Handling:** Both reading and writing to the file is done in binary mode (`'rb'` or `'wb'`), which is essential for encryption-related operations that involve non-text bytes.

- **Padding Handling:** Padding should only be accounted for during encryption. During decryption, `unpad` handles removing the padding.

- **Simplified and Correct Data Handling:** By maintaining data in its correct form (bytes for file operations and encryption/decryption), we prevent conversion errors.

This corrected implementation ensures the secure and correct use of cryptography by handling the byte streams appropriately during file operations.
