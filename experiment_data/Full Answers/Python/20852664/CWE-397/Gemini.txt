**Explanation of Changes and Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Binary File Handling:** The primary issue was handling the encrypted data as text.  Encryption/decryption deals with bytes, not strings. The code now consistently uses binary mode ('rb' and 'wb') for file operations, eliminating string conversion errors.

2. **Removed Unnecessary Padding in `decrypt_file`:** The padding logic within `decrypt_file` was incorrect and redundant, as the `decrypt` function already handles unpadding.  This extraneous code was removed.

3. **Specific Exception Handling:** The `decrypt_file` function now includes a `try-except` block specifically catching `ValueError`, which is the exception raised by the `decrypt` function when there's a padding error or the ciphertext length is not a multiple of the block size. It also catches `FileNotFoundError` in case the file doesn't exist. This demonstrates handling specific exceptions rather than a generic `Exception`.

4. **Error Reporting:** The `except` block prints informative error messages, aiding in debugging.

By handling the encrypted data as bytes and implementing targeted exception handling, the code now correctly encrypts and decrypts files. The output demonstrates that the decrypted file content matches the original plaintext.
