Key Changes:

1. **Binary File Handling:**  The primary issue stemmed from handling the encrypted data as strings.  The solution switches to binary mode (`'rb'` and `'wb'`) for file operations, ensuring data integrity.

2. **Padding Fix in `decrypt`:** Corrected a subtle error in the original `decrypt` function where the slicing for the IV was incorrectly placed *after* the unpadding.  This led to incorrect decryption even if the file I/O were fixed.  Now, the IV is separated before unpadding.

3. **Simplified Padding in `decrypt_file`:**  Removed unnecessary and erroneous re-padding in `decrypt_file`. The decryption function already handles unpadding. The original code was trying to pad a string representation of the ciphertext causing the errors.


4. **Removed `Random` and used `os.urandom`:** `Random.new()` is considered less secure for cryptographic operations. `os.urandom` is now used, which is the recommended way to generate cryptographically secure random bytes.

These changes ensure that the encryption and decryption processes handle binary data correctly, resolving the original errors and improving the security of the code.  The use of `os.urandom` further enhances the cryptographic security compared to `Random.new()`.
