**Explanation of Changes and Security Improvements:**

1. **Key Management:** The hardcoded key is removed. The `get_encryption_key()` function retrieves the key from either a `secrets.ini` file or the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. This keeps the key separate from the code. If no key exists, one is generated and stored in  `secrets.ini`.  The key is stored in the configuration file as a hex string and converted to bytes when read.

2. **Binary File Handling:** Files are opened in binary mode ('rb' and 'wb') for both reading and writing. This ensures that the encrypted data, which is binary, is handled correctly without any encoding/decoding issues. This resolves the original `TypeError` and `ValueError`.

3. **Error Handling:** A `try-except` block is added to catch and report any potential errors during file operations or encryption/decryption.

4. **Removed Unnecessary Padding in `decrypt_file()`:**  The padding logic was moved back to the `decrypt()` function where it belongs.  The padding/unpadding operations are symmetric and should be handled by the encryption/decryption functions themselves.


**How to Use:**

1. **Create `secrets.ini`:** Create a file named `secrets.ini` in the same directory as your Python script. Initially, this file can be empty, and the script will generate a new key and save it in hex format to the file.
2. **Alternatively use environment variables:** Set the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable to a 256-bit hex-encoded key (64 hex characters).

3. **Run the script:** The script will now encrypt and then decrypt 'to_enc.txt' using the securely stored key.


This improved version addresses the original error, removes the hardcoded key vulnerability, and introduces best practices for handling binary data and key management.  It offers more flexible methods of storing and retrieving the encryption key.  It is highly recommended to store encryption keys outside of version control using a robust secrets management solution for production systems.
