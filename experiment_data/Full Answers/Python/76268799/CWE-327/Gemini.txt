```python
import datetime as dt
from enum import Enum
from uuid import UUID, uuid4

from sqlalchemy import Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase, Mapped, mapped_column, DeclarativeMeta

from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ENUM


class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass


class CampaignStatus(str, Enum):
    activated = "activated"
    deactivated = "deactivated"


class Campaign(Base):
    __tablename__ = "campaign"

    id: Mapped[UUID] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)
    created_at: Mapped[dt.datetime] = mapped_column(default=dt.datetime.now)
    status: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(ENUM(CampaignStatus), nullable=False)  # Correct Usage
    # Example of additional fields using strong cryptography (if applicable):
    # sensitive_data: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(String, nullable=True) # Store encrypted data here
    # Note:  Actual encryption and decryption logic using Fernet or similar would be handled
    #        separately, likely during pre-save/post-load events, not directly in the model.


# Example usage (ensure your database connection is configured):
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine("postgresql://user:password@host:port/database")  # Replace with your DB details
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

with Session(engine) as session:
    campaign1 = Campaign(status=CampaignStatus.activated)  # Use Enum member
    session.add(campaign1)
    session.commit()

    retrieved_campaign = session.query(Campaign).first()
    print(retrieved_campaign.status) # Prints CampaignStatus.activated
    print(type(retrieved_campaign.status)) # Prints <enum 'CampaignStatus'>


```

**Explanation and Mitigation Strategy Alignment:**

1. **Correct SQLAlchemy 2.0 Enum Usage with `mapped_column`:** The primary issue was the incorrect use of `pgEnum`. With SQLAlchemy 2.0 and `mapped_column`, you should wrap the `ENUM` type directly within the `mapped_column` call: `status: Mapped[str] = mapped_column(ENUM(CampaignStatus), nullable=False)`.  We also type the column as `Mapped[str]` because SQLAlchemy will handle converting the enum to and from its string value in the database.

2. **Strong Algorithm Usage (Illustrative):**  The code includes a commented-out example of how to store `sensitive_data`. The comment emphasizes that encryption/decryption logic would be handled separately using a strong, vetted library like Fernet (for symmetric encryption) or an appropriate asymmetric encryption method when necessary.  This aligns with the mitigation strategy of using strong algorithms and avoiding custom cryptography.  The data stored in the database would be the *ciphertext* (encrypted result).

3. **Key Management (Illustrative):**  Key management is crucial.  If using Fernet, for instance, you would need a secure way to generate, store, and potentially rotate your encryption keys.  This would not be handled directly within the model but as part of your application's broader security infrastructure. Key storage mechanisms like HashiCorp Vault, AWS KMS, or Google Cloud KMS are important for production systems.

4. **Regular Updates and Best Practices:**  Using established libraries like SQLAlchemy and established encryption libraries, and staying up-to-date with their security updates, follows the best practice of not implementing custom cryptography and staying current with advancements and vulnerabilities.


This corrected code snippet directly addresses the SQLAlchemy problem and illustrates how to incorporate cryptographic principles when designing a model that might handle sensitive data.  The critical part is to handle the encryption/decryption *outside* of the model itself using a robust library and appropriate key management.  The database should only store encrypted data.
