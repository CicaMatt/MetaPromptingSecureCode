To resolve the error you're encountering with SQLAlchemy 2.0 and `mapped_column`, we need to address the use of the `ENUM` type for your `CampaignStatus` enum. The error `AttributeError: 'ENUM' object has no attribute '__mro__'` typically arises because the `ENUM` type isn't directly used as expected within the mapped column context provided by SQLAlchemy 2.0. 

Before proceeding, it's essential to understand that the code error and certificate validation are unrelated topics. However, I am focusing on providing a solution for the SQLAlchemy issue as per the problem statement. Here's how you can define your SQLAlchemy model using enums:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Enum
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ENUM as PgEnum
import sqlalchemy as sa
import enum
import datetime as dt
import uuid

Base = declarative_base()

class CampaignStatus(str, enum.Enum):
    activated = "activated"
    deactivated = "deactivated"

class Campaign(Base):
    __tablename__ = "campaign"

    id = Column(sa.UUID(as_uuid=True), primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4)
    created_at = Column(sa.DateTime, default=dt.datetime.utcnow)
    status = Column(PgEnum(CampaignStatus, name="campaignstatus", create_type=False), nullable=False)

# Example to create the table
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')

# Create the table
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

### Explanation:

- **Enum Definition**: First, we define an enumeration `CampaignStatus` inheriting from `str` and `enum.Enum`, which accurately reflects the states, `activated` and `deactivated`.

- **Database Column Types**:
  - For `id`, we're using `sa.UUID` to store UUID types.
  - For `created_at`, the column uses `sa.DateTime`, defaulting to the current UTC time.
  - For `status`, instead of `pgEnum`, we directly utilize `PgEnum` from `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`, which is compatible directly with PostgreSQL and properly handles the enum.

- **Create Table and Engine**: This snippet shows initializing a database engine and creating tables within the database. Adjust the `create_engine` connection string to fit your environment setup.

Using this pattern should not only resolve the error related to the `ENUM` object but also align with SQLAlchemy 2.0's new features and expectations.

Remember, this solution is focused on resolving your SQLAlchemy enum and model creation issue, not on certificate validation. For secure certificate validation practices in Python, you typically use libraries such as `ssl` or tools like `requests` that internally handle HTTPS requests with appropriate validations.
