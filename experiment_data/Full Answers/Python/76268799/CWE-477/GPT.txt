To address the issue with using Enums in SQLAlchemy 2.0 and the error you're encountering, you need to ensure that you're setting up the `ENUM` type correctly and using it with SQLAlchemy's new ORM syntax, including `Mapped` columns. In SQLAlchemy 2.0, the way you define and use enums and other types with the ORM has changed. Here's a refined approach that addresses the error by using SQLAlchemy's new `Enum` type from `sqlalchemy` directly rather than `pgEnum`.

Here's how you can implement this in a way that is compatible with SQLAlchemy 2.0:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Enum, create_engine, Column, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column, sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ENUM as pgEnum
import enum
import datetime as dt
from uuid import uuid4
import uuid

# Define the declarative base for ORM modeling
Base = declarative_base()

# Define the enumeration for the campaign status
class CampaignStatus(enum.Enum):
    activated = "activated"
    deactivated = "deactivated"

# Define the Campaign model with correct mapped_column usage in SQLAlchemy 2.0
class Campaign(Base):
    __tablename__ = "campaign"

    id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(default=uuid4, primary_key=True, nullable=False)
    created_at: Mapped[dt.datetime] = mapped_column(default=dt.datetime.now, nullable=False)
    status: Mapped[CampaignStatus] = mapped_column(Enum(CampaignStatus), nullable=False)

# Example configuration for a PostgreSQL database URL
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@localhost/testdb"

# Set up the engine and session
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

# Create the database tables
Base.metadata.create_all(engine)

# Now you can use the session to add and query Campaign objects from the database
```

### Explanation:

1. **Enum Definition**: We use the `enum.Enum` class to define an enumeration for campaign status. The `CampaignStatus` enum is associated with two string values, `activated` and `deactivated`.

2. **`Enum` Usage in SQLAlchemy**: We utilize SQLAlchemy's built-in `Enum` type (from `sqlalchemy` package, not `sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql`) to define the `status` column in the `Campaign` class, which maps directly to the `CampaignStatus` enum.

3. **`mapped_column`**: Instead of using `pgEnum`, you apply `Enum` directly within `mapped_column` to ensure compatibility with SQLAlchemy 2.0's `Mapped` types.

4. **Database Setup**: The code assumes PostgreSQL as the target database. Set `DATABASE_URL` to match the credentials and database of your local or remote PostgreSQL setup.

5. **Session Management**: Create an engine and session to connect to and interact with your database. This allows you to perform operations like inserting and querying data.

By refactoring the code this way, you align it with SQLAlchemy 2.0's modern practices, resolving the issue and maintaining best practices for ORM mapping and type management.
