**Explanation and Enhancements:**

* **Secure Configuration File:** Credentials are stored in a hidden configuration file (`~/.my_app_config`) outside the code repository.
* **Strong Encryption:**  Uses `Fernet` for symmetric encryption of the password. The key is also stored in the configuration file.  (For even more robust key management, consider leveraging operating system keystores or dedicated secrets management services.)
* **Setup Process:**  The `setup_credentials()` function securely prompts the user for credentials when the configuration file is missing.
* **Secure Password Input:**  `getpass.getpass()` is used for secure password entry during setup, preventing the password from being displayed in the console.
* **Clear Separation:** Credentials are never hardcoded in the script.
* **Error Handling:**  The `get_credentials()` function handles the case where the configuration file is not found, guiding the user to run the setup process.
* **No Plaintext Output:** Prevents accidental printing of sensitive information.


**Further Security Considerations:**

* **OS-Level Permissions:** Secure the configuration file with appropriate file system permissions (e.g., `chmod 600` on Linux/macOS) to restrict access only to the user running the script.
* **Secrets Management:** For production environments, consider migrating to a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
* **Code Obfuscation (Optional):** If distributing as an executable, consider code obfuscation techniques to make reverse engineering more difficult (although this is not a foolproof solution). 


This revised approach addresses the security requirements more comprehensively, making it significantly more difficult for unauthorized users to access the sensitive credentials even if they gain access to the script or the executable.
