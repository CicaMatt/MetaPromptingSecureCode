To address the security concerns mentioned and provide secure encryption and decryption functions using the PyCrypto library (more commonly these days, it is recommended to use the updated PyCryptodome library), we need to follow specific cryptographic best practices. This includes using strong algorithms like AES, ensuring proper length for keys, and managing Initialization Vectors (IV) correctly.

Here's a code snippet that demonstrates secure encryption and decryption using AES in CBC mode with PyCryptodome:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Protocol.KDF import PBKDF2
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
import base64

def encrypt(message, key):
    # Derive a 256-bit AES key using PBKDF2 to ensure appropriate key length
    salt = get_random_bytes(16)
    private_key = PBKDF2(key, salt, dkLen=32)
    
    # Initialize AES cipher in CBC mode with a random IV
    iv = get_random_bytes(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(private_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

    # Pad message to be of block length
    padded_message = pad(message)
    cipher_text = cipher.encrypt(padded_message.encode('utf-8'))

    # Concatenate IV and ciphertext and base64 encode the result
    return base64.b64encode(salt + iv + cipher_text).decode('utf-8')


def decrypt(enc_message, key):
    # Decode the base64 encoded message
    enc = base64.b64decode(enc_message)
    
    # Extract salt, IV, and ciphertext
    salt = enc[:16]
    iv = enc[16:16+AES.block_size]
    cipher_text = enc[16+AES.block_size:]
    
    # Re-derive the AES key
    private_key = PBKDF2(key, salt, dkLen=32)
    
    # Initialize AES cipher in CBC mode with the extracted IV
    cipher = AES.new(private_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    
    # Decrypt and unpad the message
    decrypted_padded_message = cipher.decrypt(cipher_text)
    return unpad(decrypted_padded_message).decode('utf-8')


def pad(s):
    # Pad the message to ensure it is a multiple of AES block size
    pad_length = AES.block_size - len(s) % AES.block_size
    return s + (chr(pad_length) * pad_length)


def unpad(s):
    # Unpad the message
    pad_length = s[-1]
    return s[:-pad_length]


# Example usage:
message = "This is a secret message."
key = "my_super_secure_key"  # Note: Use a secure, high-entropy key in real applications

encrypted_msg = encrypt(message, key)
print(f"Encrypted Message: {encrypted_msg}")

decrypted_msg = decrypt(encrypted_msg, key)
print(f"Decrypted Message: {decrypted_msg}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Algorithm Choice**: We use AES with a 256-bit key length which is widely considered secure and is FIPS-compliant.

2. **Key Derivation**: We use PBKDF2 to derive a strong key from the input key string. This ensures that the key is of the appropriate length for AES and is securely derived.

3. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: We use a random IV for each encryption operation to ensure that the same plaintext encrypts differently each time. The IV is stored with the ciphertext which is standard practice as long as it is not reused and doesn't have to be secret.

4. **Padding**: We apply PKCS#7 (sometimes just referred to as padding with the value of missing length) to make sure that the plaintext fits into AES block size.

5. **Base64 Encoding**: The salt, IV, and encrypted message are combined and base64-encoded to produce the final ciphertext string, making it easy to store or transmit as text.

This approach addresses the CWE-327 concern by choosing a strong cryptographic algorithm, ensuring key/IV management, and using correct padding schemes.
