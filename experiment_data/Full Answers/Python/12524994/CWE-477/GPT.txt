To address the concerns you've raised regarding PyCrypto and to replace outdated or insecure functions, it's advisable to switch to using `pycryptodome`, a more maintained fork of `pycrypto`. Additionally, this solution will ensure secure encryption practices by using AES with a secure key length, padding, and a recommended mode of operation.

Here is the complete code snippet that provides encryption and decryption functions using `pycryptodome`:

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

def encrypt_message(message: bytes, key: bytes) -> dict:
    # Ensure the key is 32 bytes long (256 bits) for AES-256
    key = pad(key, AES.block_size)[:32]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC)

    # Generate a random IV (initialization vector)
    iv = cipher.iv

    # Pad the message to be a multiple of the block size and encrypt
    encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(pad(message, AES.block_size))

    return {'iv': iv, 'ciphertext': encrypted_message}

def decrypt_message(ciphertext: bytes, key: bytes, iv: bytes) -> bytes:
    # Ensure the key is 32 bytes long (256 bits) for AES-256
    key = pad(key, AES.block_size)[:32]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv=iv)

    # Decrypt and unpad the message
    decrypted_message = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ciphertext), AES.block_size)

    return decrypted_message


# Example usage:
# Make sure to convert messages and keys to bytes
message = b"This is a secret message."
key = b"mysecurekey"

encryption_result = encrypt_message(message, key)
print("Encrypted:", encryption_result['ciphertext'])

# Use the iv from the encryption result
decrypted_message = decrypt_message(encryption_result['ciphertext'], key, encryption_result['iv'])
print("Decrypted:", decrypted_message)
```

### Key Points:
1. **Switch to `pycryptodome`**: This module is actively maintained and a direct replacement for `pycrypto`.

2. **Key Management**: To ensure that the key length is appropriate for AES (AES-256 in this case), we pad and truncate the key to 32 bytes. This approach guarantees robustness in key size.

3. **Cipher Mode**: AES in CBC mode is used for encryption. CBC is a widely recommended mode that provides a good balance of security and performance for most scenarios.

4. **Initialization Vector (IV)**: A random IV is generated using `AES.new()` for each encryption operation, enhancing the security of the cipher. It is crucial to use the same IV for both encryption and decryption. The IV must be preserved and transmitted along with the ciphertext.

5. **Padding**: The plaintext is padded to ensure it fits into blocks of AES's block size, which is necessary for most block cipher modes. `Crypto.Util.Padding` is used to add and remove this padding.

By following these practices, you minimize security vulnerabilities associated with outdated methods and ensure your encryption/decryption functions are robust and secure.
