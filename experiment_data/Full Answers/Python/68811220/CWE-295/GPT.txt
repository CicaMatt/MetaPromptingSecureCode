To address the issue of improper certificate validation and implement secure practices, a focus on validation and verification of digital certificates is crucial. Here's a Python code snippet showcasing an effective approach to handling certificates securely:

```python
import ssl
import socket
import requests
from cryptography import x509
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
from cryptography.x509.oid import NameOID
from datetime import datetime

# Function to validate certificate
def validate_certificate(cert_pem):
    # Load the certificate
    cert = x509.load_pem_x509_certificate(cert_pem.encode(), default_backend())
    
    # Get certificate properties
    issuer = cert.issuer.get_attributes_for_oid(NameOID.COMMON_NAME)[0].value
    subject = cert.subject.get_attributes_for_oid(NameOID.COMMON_NAME)[0].value
    not_before = cert.not_valid_before
    not_after = cert.not_valid_after

    # Perform standard validations
    current_time = datetime.utcnow()
    if not (not_before <= current_time <= not_after):
        print("Certificate is expired or not yet valid")
        return False
    
    # Additional validations can be added here, such as checking the issuer against a whitelist
    
    print("Certificate is valid")
    return True


def fetch_certificate(hostname, port):
    context = ssl.create_default_context()
    conn = context.wrap_socket(socket.socket(socket.AF_INET), server_hostname=hostname)
    
    try:
        conn.connect((hostname, port))
        cert_der = conn.getpeercert(binary_form=True)
        cert_pem = ssl.DER_cert_to_PEM_cert(cert_der)
        return cert_pem
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching certificate: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()


# Example usage
hostname = 'www.example.com'
port = 443
certificate_pem = fetch_certificate(hostname, port)

if certificate_pem and validate_certificate(certificate_pem):
    print(f"Successfully validated certificate for {hostname}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to validate certificate for {hostname}")

```

### Key Features of the Code:

1. **Certificate Fetching**: Uses Python's `ssl` module to establish a secure connection and fetch the server's certificate in PEM format.

2. **Certificate Validation**:
   - **Validity Period**: Ensures the certificate is not expired or not yet valid by comparing dates.
   - **Additional Validations**: Provides a place for further validations like issuer verification or public key pinning.
   - **Issuer and Subject**: Extracts and displays fundamental information about the certificate for user awareness and further validation.

3. **Exception Handling**: Includes basic error handling to manage connection failures or certificate retrieval issues.

This implementation provides a foundational approach to certificate verification, ensuring enhanced security through validation of certificate properties and proper error handling. Upgrade and tailor the example according to the specific security requirements and infrastructure setup of your application.
