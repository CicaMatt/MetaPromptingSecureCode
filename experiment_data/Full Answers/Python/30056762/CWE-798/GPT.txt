To address the problem statement and fix the code, we'll refactor the RSA encryption and decryption logic. The key improvements include handling encoded bytes properly and separating the reading and writing of encrypted data in a more reliable way. Additionally, using RSA.encrypt and RSA.decrypt directly is now considered deprecated; instead, we'll use the `PKCS1_OAEP` cipher, which is both secure and simplifies encryption and decryption.

Here's the corrected code using the `PyCryptodome` library:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Crypto import Random

# Generate RSA keys
random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(2048, random_generator)  # Increase the key size for better security
public_key = key.publickey()

# Initialize cipher objects for encryption and decryption
cipher_encrypt = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
cipher_decrypt = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)

# Original message
original_message = "encrypt this message"
original_message_bytes = original_message.encode()  # Convert message to bytes

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = cipher_encrypt.encrypt(original_message_bytes)

# Save the encrypted message to a file
with open('encryption.txt', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(encrypted_message)

# Read the encrypted message from the file
with open('encryption.txt', 'rb') as f:
    encrypted_message_from_file = f.read()

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message_bytes = cipher_decrypt.decrypt(encrypted_message_from_file)
decrypted_message = decrypted_message_bytes.decode()  # Convert bytes back to string

print('Encrypted Message:', encrypted_message)
print('Decrypted Message:', decrypted_message)
```

### Key Points:

- **Use of PKCS1_OAEP:** We initialize `PKCS1_OAEP` cipher objects for encryption and decryption, offering a higher level of security than direct use of the `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods on the key.
  
- **File Operations:** We open the file in binary mode (`'wb'` for writing and `'rb'` for reading) to handle raw byte data, which is typical for encrypted data.

- **Encoding and Decoding:** We convert string messages to bytes before encryption (`.encode()`) and back to strings after decryption (`.decode()`), ensuring compatibility with the encryption and file writing operations.

This solution demonstrates secure handling of RSA encryption and decryption and serves as a basis for avoiding hard-coded credentials by securing sensitive data instead.
