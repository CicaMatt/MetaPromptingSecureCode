# Generate RSA key pair
random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(2048, random_generator)  # Use a stronger key size (2048 bits or higher)

public_key = key.publickey().exportKey()

# Encrypt the message

**Key Improvements and Security Considerations:**

* **Stronger Key Size:**  Uses 2048-bit RSA key, which is the recommended minimum for security.
* **PKCS1_OAEP Padding:**  Employs PKCS1_OAEP padding for enhanced security compared to simpler padding schemes.
* **Base64 Encoding:** Encodes the ciphertext using Base64 before writing to the file.  This ensures that the ciphertext can be safely stored and transmitted as text.
* **Secure Private Key Handling (Crucial):**  Demonstrates how to export and import keys. In a real application, store the private key **securely** (e.g., in an encrypted file, using a secrets management service like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault), and load it only when needed. **Never hardcode the private key in your application.**
* **Error Handling:** In real-world scenarios, incorporate error handling (e.g., `try...except` blocks) to handle potential issues during file operations or decryption.
* **Key Management:**  Key management is paramount. Establish robust procedures for key generation, storage, rotation, and revocation.
* **Secrets Management Tools:** For production systems, strongly consider using dedicated secrets management tools for secure credential storage.


This revised code addresses the original problem of incorrect decryption and emphasizes critical security best practices for handling cryptographic keys and sensitive data.  Remember that security is an ongoing process, and staying informed about best practices is essential.
