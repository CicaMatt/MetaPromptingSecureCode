To address the problem you're facing with RSA encryption and decryption and to implement the security mitigation strategies, I'll provide a complete, secure Python code snippet. We will utilize the `pycryptodome` library, which provides robust support for cryptographic operations, and we will handle exceptions specifically. Let's also ensure the cryptographic key and encrypted message are managed securely: 

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Crypto import Random
import ast

def generate_key_pair():
    random_generator = Random.new().read
    key = RSA.generate(2048, random_generator)  # Use 2048-bit RSA key for stronger security
    public_key = key.publickey()
    return key, public_key

def encrypt_message(public_key, message):
    # Utilize PKCS1_OAEP for encryption which is more secure
    cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
    encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message.encode('utf-8'))
    return encrypted_message

def decrypt_message(private_key, encrypted_message):
    try:
        cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(private_key)
        decrypted_message = cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message)
        return decrypted_message.decode('utf-8')
    except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
        print(f"Decryption failed: {e}")
        return None

def write_to_file(file_name, data):
    with open(file_name, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(data)

def read_from_file(file_name):
    with open(file_name, 'rb') as f:
        return f.read()

# Key generation
private_key, public_key = generate_key_pair()

# Encrypt the message
message = "Encrypt this message securely."
encrypted_message = encrypt_message(public_key, message)
print('Encrypted message (byte format):', encrypted_message)

# Write encrypted message to a file
write_to_file('encryption.txt', encrypted_message)

# Read encrypted message from the file
encrypted_message_from_file = read_from_file('encryption.txt')

# Decrypt the message
decrypted_message = decrypt_message(private_key, encrypted_message_from_file)
if decrypted_message:
    print('Decrypted message:', decrypted_message)
```

**Mitigation Justifications:**

1. **Key Size**: We use a 2048-bit key size for RSA which provides stronger security than 1024-bit keys.
   
2. **Encryption Scheme**: PKCS1_OAEP is utilized for encryption and decryption, offering better security against certain attacks compared to the deprecated RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding.

3. **Specific Exceptions**: Handling `ValueError` and `TypeError` exceptions to catch decryption issues more specifically and avoid the use of generic exception handling.

4. **Secure File Handling**: Use binary read/write ('wb'/'rb') when dealing with encrypted content to avoid issues with data interpretation.

This code and approach should resolve your issue with reading from the file and decrypting effectively while incorporating appropriate security practices. Make sure to have `pycryptodome` installed via `pip install pycryptodome` to run this code.
