Below is a secure Python code snippet that addresses the problem statement while incorporating the provided mitigation strategies. The code uses RSA encryption and decryption, reads and writes ciphertext to a file securely, and adheres to best practices.

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Crypto import Random
import ast

# Generate a secure random number generator
random_generator = Random.new().read

# Generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair (stronger than 1024-bit for better security)
key = RSA.generate(2048, random_generator)

# Export the public key for encryption
public_key = key.publickey()

# Create a cipher object for encryption using PKCS1_OAEP padding
cipher_encrypt = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)

# Message to encrypt
message = b"encrypt this message"

# Encrypt the message
encrypted_message = cipher_encrypt.encrypt(message)

# Write the encrypted message (ciphertext) to a file securely
with open('encryption.txt', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(encrypted_message)

# Read the encrypted message (ciphertext) from the file
with open('encryption.txt', 'rb') as f:
    ciphertext = f.read()

# Create a cipher object for decryption using PKCS1_OAEP padding
cipher_decrypt = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)

# Decrypt the ciphertext
decrypted_message = cipher_decrypt.decrypt(ciphertext)

# Print the decrypted message
print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message.decode())

# Write the decrypted message to a file securely
with open('decryption.txt', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(decrypted_message)
```

### **Explanation of Security Measures and Logic**

1. **Strong Cryptographic Algorithms**:
   - The code uses RSA with a 2048-bit key length, which is more secure than 1024-bit.
   - PKCS1_OAEP padding is used for encryption and decryption, which is more secure than raw RSA.

2. **Avoid Hard-Coded Credentials**:
   - The private key is generated dynamically and not hard-coded.
   - The encrypted message is stored in a file, and the private key is not exposed in the code.

3. **Secure File Handling**:
   - Files are opened in binary mode (`'wb'` and `'rb'`) to ensure proper handling of encrypted data.
   - The `with` statement is used for file operations to ensure proper file closure even if an error occurs.

4. **Prevent Generic Exception Handling**:
   - The code does not use generic exception handling. Specific exceptions (e.g., file I/O errors) should be handled in a production environment.

5. **Avoid Obsolete Functions**:
   - The code uses modern cryptographic libraries (`Crypto.Cipher.PKCS1_OAEP`) instead of deprecated or insecure methods.

6. **Secure Random Number Generation**:
   - The `Random.new().read` function is used to generate a secure random number generator for key generation.

### **Output Files**
- `encryption.txt`: Contains the encrypted message (ciphertext).
- `decryption.txt`: Contains the decrypted message (plaintext).

This solution ensures secure RSA encryption and decryption while adhering to best practices and mitigation strategies.
