**Explanation of Changes and Mitigation Strategies Applied:**

1. **String Encoding/Decoding:** The original code tried to encrypt a string directly.  RSA operates on bytes. The provided solution encodes the string to bytes before encryption and decodes back to a string after decryption using UTF-8 encoding.

2. **Safe Tuple Handling:** Instead of directly writing the tuple representation to the file, the code now uses `repr(encrypted)` to create a string representation that can be safely evaluated later. When reading from the file, `ast.literal_eval()` safely converts the string back into the original tuple, avoiding potential security risks associated with `eval()`.

3. **Specific Exception Handling:** The code now includes a `try-except` block that catches `ValueError`, `SyntaxError`, and `TypeError`. These are the specific exceptions that could be raised if the ciphertext in the file is corrupted or not in the expected format. A more general `Exception` block remains for demonstration and to indicate that ideally a more specific set of exceptions should be caught. *In production, avoid broad `Exception` catches.*

4. **Error Messages:** The `except` blocks now provide more informative error messages, helping with debugging.

5. **Padding for Encryption:** The encrypt method now includes the second parameter, `32`. This provides padding, which is crucial for the security of RSA encryption.  Without padding, the encryption is very vulnerable.



These changes address the core issue of correctly reading and decrypting the ciphertext from the file and also incorporates best practices for handling exceptions and ensuring secure RSA encryption.  The use of `ast.literal_eval` and explicit error handling improves the robustness and security of the code.  Padding is added for secure encryption.
