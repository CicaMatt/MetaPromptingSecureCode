To address the problem statement and implement RSA encryption and decryption in Python correctly, it's important to handle the encoding and decoding of encrypted messages and imported keys correctly. Using Python's `pycryptodome` library for RSA encryption ensures best practices in cryptography.

Here's a revised code snippet that fixes the original code's issues and securely handles RSA encryption and decryption:

```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes

# Generate RSA key pair
key = RSA.generate(2048)  # Use a 2048-bit key for better security
public_key = key.publickey()

# Convert message to bytes; encryption requires byte input
message = b'encrypt this message'

# Encrypt message with public key using PKCS1_OAEP
cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(public_key)
encrypted_message = cipher.encrypt(message)

# Write the encrypted message to a file
with open('encryption.txt', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(encrypted_message)

# Read the encrypted message from the file
with open('encryption.txt', 'rb') as f:
    encrypted_message_from_file = f.read()

# Decrypt the message using the private key
decrypt_cipher = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)
decrypted_message = decrypt_cipher.decrypt(encrypted_message_from_file)

# Print the decrypted message
print('Decrypted message:', decrypted_message.decode('utf-8'))
```

### Key Enhancements:

1. **PKCS1_OAEP Cipher:** This cipher is used for RSA encryption, providing OAEP padding for enhanced security during encryption and decryption.

2. **Using a 2048-bit RSA Key Pair:** A 2048-bit key offers a more secure option over a 1024-bit key, meeting current cryptographic security standards.

3. **Binary File Handling:** When encrypting, we handle the message and ciphertext as bytes, which is necessary for correct encryption and decryption processes.

4. **Secure Message Handling:** The message is converted to bytes and carefully managed during encryption and decryption operations, using appropriate encoding and decoding methods to convert between byte strings and readable strings.

By carefully managing the keys and ensuring secure encryption and decryption operations, the security of the communication channel is maintained.
