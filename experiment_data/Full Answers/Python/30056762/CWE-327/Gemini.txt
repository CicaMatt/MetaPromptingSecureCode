```python
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Cipher import PKCS1_OAEP
from Crypto.Random import get_random_bytes
import ast

# Key Generation (using RSA, a strong algorithm, but with improved padding)
key = RSA.generate(2048) # Increased key size for better security
private_key = key.export_key()
public_key = key.publickey().export_key()

# Encryption (using PKCS1_OAEP padding for enhanced security)
message = b'encrypt this message' # Byte string for encryption
cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key) # Using the private key for encryption is equivalent to using public key for encryption followed by private key for decryption.
ciphertext = cipher_rsa.encrypt(message)

# Write ciphertext to file
with open('encryption.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(str(ciphertext))  # Store as string representation

# Decryption (using PKCS1_OAEP padding and handling byte conversions)
with open('encryption.txt', 'r') as f:
    ciphertext_str = f.read()

# Crucial step: convert the string representation back to bytes
ciphertext_loaded = ast.literal_eval(ciphertext_str)

# Decryption using the private key:
cipher_rsa = PKCS1_OAEP.new(key)  # Use the private key for decryption
decrypted_message = cipher_rsa.decrypt(ciphertext_loaded)

# Print decrypted message
print('decrypted:', decrypted_message.decode()) # Decode back to string


# Write original and decrypted message to file (optional)
with open('encryption.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write(f"Original Message: {message.decode()}\n") # Store original as well for verification
    f.write(f"Decrypted Message: {decrypted_message.decode()}\n") # Decode back to string

```


**Explanation of Improvements:**

1. **Stronger Algorithm and Padding:** Instead of using just `publickey.encrypt()` with a hardcoded padding value (which can be insecure), we now use `PKCS1_OAEP` padding with RSA.  This is an industry-standard padding scheme that significantly strengthens the security of RSA encryption.
2. **Larger Key Size:**  The RSA key size is increased to 2048 bits, which provides much stronger security than 1024 bits.
3. **Proper String/Bytes Handling:** The code correctly handles the conversion between bytes (required for encryption/decryption) and strings (for file storage).  The `ast.literal_eval()` function is used for safe evaluation of the literal string representation of the ciphertext bytes. This prevents the previous issue where the string representation was being directly passed to the decryption function.
4. **Secure File Handling:**  The code uses `with open(...)` which ensures files are properly closed, even if errors occur.
5. **Clearer Output:**  The output now shows both the original and decrypted messages, which is helpful for verification.
6. **Key Management Improvement:** Shows basic key export for public and private keys. In a real application, this process needs more robust handling (e.g., storage in secure files, key rotation, etc.).


This improved code demonstrates a more robust and secure way to perform RSA encryption and decryption in Python. It addresses the original problem, adheres to best practices, and incorporates important security considerations.  It also highlights crucial aspects of proper data type handling (bytes vs. strings) when dealing with cryptographic operations.
