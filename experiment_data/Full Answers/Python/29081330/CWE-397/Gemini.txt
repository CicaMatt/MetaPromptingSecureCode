The issue was with the `restrict_xpaths` argument in the `LinkExtractor`. It was extracting the `href` *attribute* as a string, not the element itself. The `_iter_links` method expected an element object that has an `iter` method, but it received a string, resulting in the `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'iter'`.  The solution removes `@href` and uses a broader XPath expression to select the `<a>` elements themselves.  A try-except block is added for robustness in `parse_link`, though ideally more specific exceptions would be caught if known.  Additionally, slightly more robust XPath expressions (e.g., `//` replaced with `//*[@class=...` where possible) are used as a general best practice.
