**Explanation of Fixes and Security Best Practices (Not directly related to the original error but important):**

1. **`restrict_xpaths` Error:** The original error, `'str' object has no attribute 'iter'`, arose because `restrict_xpaths` expects an iterable of XPath expressions (or a single XPath expression), but it was receiving a string representing the *result* of an XPath expression (the `href` attribute).  The solution uses correct XPath expressions that select the *elements* containing the links, not the attribute itself.  Additionally, it leverages `contains(@class, 'classname')` instead of exact class matching (`@class='classname'`) to accommodate potential variations in class names. This is crucial for robustness as websites often change class names.

2. **Relative XPaths:** Inside the `parse_link` method, XPaths should start with `.` to make them relative to the current `sel` (selection). Without the dot, the XPath searches from the root of the document, potentially leading to incorrect data extraction.

3. **Handling Multiple Classes:** Using `and` within XPath expressions allows selecting elements with multiple classes. This is more reliable than matching the exact class string.


**Security Best Practices (Example related to storing API keys):**

```python
import os

# Retrieve API key from environment variable
API_KEY = os.environ.get("MY_API_KEY")

if API_KEY is None:
    raise ValueError("MY_API_KEY environment variable not set.")

# ... use API_KEY in your spider ...

```

This example demonstrates fetching an API key (or any sensitive credential) from an environment variable.  This keeps secrets out of your codebase and allows you to manage them separately.  Consider using more robust solutions like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager for large-scale applications.  Never hardcode secrets directly in your code.


By implementing these fixes and adhering to security best practices, the Scrapy spider will function correctly and the risk of credential compromise will be significantly reduced.
