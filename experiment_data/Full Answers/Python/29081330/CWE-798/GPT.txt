The error you're encountering indicates that there's an issue with how the restrict_xpaths rules are being applied. Specifically, the error "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'iter'" suggests that the XPath expression might be returning strings (or incorrect elements) instead of the needed elements.

Let's troubleshoot and modify your Scrapy spider to resolve this issue. We'll revise the XPath expressions used in the `restrict_xpaths` parameter to ensure they target the correct elements.

Here's the revised code snippet for your Scrapy spider:

```python
import scrapy
from tutorial.items import DmozItem
from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor

class TsrSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = 'tsr'
    allowed_domains = ['thestudentroom.co.uk']
    start_urls = ['http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=143']

    download_delay = 4
    user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0'

    rules = (
        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow=('forumdisplay\.php\?f=143\&page=\d',),
                restrict_xpaths="//li[@class='pager-page_numbers']/a")),  # Removed @href here

        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow=('showthread\.php\?t=\d+\&page=\d+',),
                restrict_xpaths="//li[@class='pager-page_numbers']/a"),  # Removed @href here
            callback='parse_link'),

        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow=('showthread\.php\?t=\d+',),
                restrict_xpaths="//tr[contains(@class, 'thread') and contains(@class, 'unread')]"),  # Replaced space-separated class names with contains
            callback='parse_link'),
    )

    def parse_link(self, response):
        # Iterate over posts.     
        for sel in response.xpath("//li[contains(@class, 'post') and contains(@class, 'threadpost') and contains(@class, 'old')]"):
            rating = sel.xpath("div[@class='post-footer']//span[@class='score']/text()").extract_first(default="0")
            
            item = DmozItem()
            item['post'] = sel.xpath("div[@class='post-content']/blockquote[@class='postcontent restore']/text()").extract()
            item['link'] = response.url
            item['topic'] = response.xpath("//div[@class='forum-header section-header']/h1/span/text()").extract_first()
            item['rating'] = rating
            yield item
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Restrict XPaths Adjustments**: 
    - Removed `@href` from `restrict_xpaths` since LinkExtractor doesn't require it directly. It automatically looks for links within the selected nodes.
    - Used `contains` for class-based XPath selectors to ensure correct class matching, as HTML might have multiple classes.

2. **XPath Expressions**:
    - Used `extract_first(default="0")` to simplify extraction and provide a default value.
    - Use `extract_first()` rather than `extract()` for single-value extractions when you only need one item.

These adjustments should help ensure the XPath expressions are pointing to the correct elements and should hopefully resolve the issue you're facing. If there's still an issue, ensure that the site structure matches what's expected, as it might have changed since the time of creating the spider.
