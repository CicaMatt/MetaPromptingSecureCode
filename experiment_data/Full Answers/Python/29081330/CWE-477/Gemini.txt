**Explanation of Changes and Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **Updated Scrapy Components:** The code is updated to use the newer `scrapy.spiders` instead of the deprecated `scrapy.contrib.spiders`. Similarly, `scrapy.linkextractors` replaces `scrapy.contrib.linkextractors`.

2. **`restrict_xpaths` Correction:** The core issue was the `restrict_xpaths` expressions. These were extracting attributes (`@href`) instead of node elements. The solution changes them to extract the `a` elements directly.  Furthermore, using `contains(@class, 'classname')` instead of exact class matching (`@class='classname'`) handles dynamic class names more robustly, a common practice in modern web development.

3. **`extract_first()`:** Instead of `extract()[0]`, which can raise an `IndexError`, the code uses `extract_first()`.  This returns `None` if no element is found, making the code more robust.

4. **Relative XPaths:** Inside the `parse_link` function, the XPaths are changed to be relative to the current `sel` using `.//`. This makes the selectors more specific and less prone to errors.

5. **Simplified Rating Assignment:**  The `if not rating:` block is simplified using the `or` operator.

By applying these changes, the code is not only fixed but also modernized to use current best practices, making it more maintainable, robust, and less susceptible to future issues. This aligns with the principle of replacing obsolete functionalities with modern, secure alternatives.
