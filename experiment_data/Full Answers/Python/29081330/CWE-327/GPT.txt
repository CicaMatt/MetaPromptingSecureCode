The error you're encountering involves an `AttributeError` due to a misuse of the `lxml` library when dealing with XPath selections in your Scrapy Spider. The traceback indicates that there is an attempt to iterate over an object that is expected to be an `etree.Element`, but it's actually a `string`. This usually results from incorrect usage in the `restrict_xpaths` parameter.

Let's approach solving this problem by addressing how `restrict_xpaths` is used within your `LinkExtractor`. It appears that you're trying to apply XPath expressions directly, which might lead to incorrect parsing when the structure of the HTML doesn't match what you're expecting.

Furthermore, your issue doesn't seem related to cryptographic algorithms directly, but adjusting how you're utilizing the XPath within Scrapy's `LinkExtractor`.

Here's a revised code snippet that should address the iteration problem while maintaining clarity in your spider logic:

```python
import scrapy
from tutorial.items import DmozItem
from scrapy.spiders import CrawlSpider, Rule
from scrapy.linkextractors import LinkExtractor

class TsrSpider(CrawlSpider):
    name = 'tsr'
    allowed_domains = ['thestudentroom.co.uk']
    start_urls = ['http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forumdisplay.php?f=143']

    download_delay = 4
    user_agent = 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0'

    rules = (
        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow=('forumdisplay\.php\?f=143\&page=\d',),
                restrict_xpaths=("//li[@class='pager-page_numbers']/a")),  # Corrected XPath
            follow=True),

        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow=('showthread\.php\?t=\d+\&page=\d+',),
                restrict_xpaths=("//li[@class='pager-page_numbers']/a")),  # Corrected XPath
            callback='parse_link',
            follow=True),

        Rule(
            LinkExtractor(
                allow=('showthread\.php\?t=\d+',),
                restrict_xpaths=("//tr[@class='thread unread']")),
            callback='parse_link',
            follow=True),
    )

    def parse_link(self, response):
        for sel in response.xpath("//li[@class='post threadpost old']"):
            rating = sel.xpath("div[@class='post-footer']//span[@class='score']/text()").get(default='0')
            item = DmozItem()
            item['post'] = sel.xpath("div[@class='post-content']/blockquote[@class='postcontent restore']/text()").getall()
            item['link'] = response.url
            item['topic'] = response.xpath("//div[@class='forum-header section-header']/h1/span/text()").get()
            item['rating'] = rating
            yield item
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Corrected XPath Expressions**: Ensure that `restrict_xpaths` is targeting elements, not attributes (omit the `@href` part). We need the link element itself for `LinkExtractor`.
2. **Get and Getall**: Use `get()` and `getall()` to appropriately process XPath results and handle default values when results are missing.
3. **Following Links**: Set `follow=True` for rules to continue following links matching your criteria.

### Note: 
- The rewrite maintains the same core functionality but corrects the XPath usage to ensure the elements are iterated over correctly by Scrapy's `LinkExtractor`.
- Always test the spider in a controlled environment to verify it works as intended with the actual HTML structure. Adjust XPath queries based on the exact HTML you are working with.
