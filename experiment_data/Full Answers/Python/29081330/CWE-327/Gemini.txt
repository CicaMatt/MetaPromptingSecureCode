The primary issue was with `restrict_xpaths` usage. It should point to the *element* containing the link, not the `@href` attribute itself.  LinkExtractor then extracts the `href` attribute.  The code also had overly specific XPath expressions that could break with minor website changes.  The improved selectors using `contains(@class, ...)` are more robust.  For the third rule,  `/td[2]/a` was added to select the `<a>` element within the table row. Finally, the rating extraction was simplified using a conditional expression.

While this code addresses the immediate scraping issue, the prompt also mentions cryptography.  This scraper doesn't directly use cryptography, so the mitigation strategies aren't directly applicable. However, if the scraped data is sensitive, it's crucial to ensure it's stored and transmitted securely, adhering to best practices like encryption at rest and in transit. If any cryptographic operations *were* involved, the recommended strong algorithms (AES-256, SHA-256, etc.) and key management principles should be followed rigorously. Using established libraries like `cryptography` would be recommended.
