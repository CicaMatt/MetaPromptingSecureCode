# Example of storing credentials securely (using environment variables for this example)
# In a real application, consider using a dedicated secrets management system.
# export ENCRYPTION_IV=7bde5a0f3f39fd658efc45de143cbc94
# export ENCRYPTION_KEY=3e83b13d99bf0de6c6bde5ac5ca4ae68

# To run this code:
# 1. Set the environment variables as shown above.
# 2. Execute the script.

**Explanation and Improvements:**

1. **Secure Credential Storage:** The code retrieves the encryption key and IV from environment variables.  This removes hard-coded credentials from the codebase.  For production, a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) is recommended.

2. **Cryptography Library:**  Uses the `cryptography` library, which is the recommended way to handle cryptographic operations in Python.  It provides secure and well-vetted implementations of encryption algorithms.

3. **PKCS7 Padding:**  Implements PKCS7 padding, which is crucial for AES-CBC mode when the message length is not a multiple of the block size.

4. **Clear Function Definition:** The encryption process is encapsulated in a well-defined function `encrypt_message`, making the code more organized and reusable.

5. **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling to ensure that the required environment variables are set.

6. **Avoid Printing Sensitive Data:** The code avoids printing the actual key in the final output, although it's shown here for demonstration purposes during development.  Never log or print sensitive information in production.

7. **Documentation:** Added comments to explain the code and the secure credential storage process.


This revised solution directly addresses the security concerns of hard-coded credentials by using environment variables (or a secrets management system) and follows best practices for secure encryption in Python.  It's also more robust and maintainable due to the improved code structure.
