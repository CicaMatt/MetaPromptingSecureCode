To replace the OpenSSL command-line usage with a native Python solution for AES-128-CBC encryption using base64 output, you can use the `cryptography` library, a robust and well-maintained library for cryptographic operations in Python. This approach is secure, efficient, and avoids the security risks associated with executing shell commands. Below is a Python code snippet that achieves the encryption of a message using the same parameters as your OpenSSL command:

Here is the Python code:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend
import base64
import os

def encrypt_aes_128_cbc_base64(msg, key, iv):
    # Convert the input parameters from hex to bytes
    key_bytes = bytes.fromhex(key)
    iv_bytes = bytes.fromhex(iv)

    # Ensure the message is a multiple of block size (16 bytes for AES)
    # PKCS7 padding or similar can be used here, but we'll keep it simple.
    padded_msg = msg + (16 - len(msg) % 16) * chr(16 - len(msg) % 16)
    padded_msg_bytes = padded_msg.encode()

    # Create a Cipher object
    cipher = Cipher(algorithms.AES(key_bytes), modes.CBC(iv_bytes), backend=default_backend())
    encryptor = cipher.encryptor()

    # Perform the encryption
    encrypted_bytes = encryptor.update(padded_msg_bytes) + encryptor.finalize()

    # Encode the result in base64
    encrypted_base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(encrypted_bytes)
    encrypted_base64 = encrypted_base64_bytes.decode()

    return encrypted_base64

# Input parameters
iv = "7bde5a0f3f39fd658efc45de143cbc94"
password = "3e83b13d99bf0de6c6bde5ac5ca4ae68"
msg = "this is a message"

# Encrypt the message
out = encrypt_aes_128_cbc_base64(msg, password, iv)

# Print results
print(f"IV: {iv}")
print(f"PWD: {password}")
print(f"MSG: {msg}")
print(f"OUT: {out}")
```

### Explanation:
- **Padding**: The message is padded to ensure it is a multiple of the block size (16 bytes for AES). This implementation uses simple PKCS7-style padding.
- **hex to byte conversion**: Both the `key` and `iv` are converted from their hexadecimal string representation to byte arrays for encryption.
- **Cipher setup**: We use the AES algorithm with CBC mode, utilizing the key and IV provided and the `default_backend`.
- **Base64 Encoding**: After encryption, the ciphertext is encoded in base64 for output compatibility with the original OpenSSL command.

This code provides a secure and modern approach to encryption without relying on an external OpenSSL call, adhering to best practices and modern conventions in Python cryptography.
