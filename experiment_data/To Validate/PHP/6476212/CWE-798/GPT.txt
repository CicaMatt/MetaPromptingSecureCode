**Objective:**  
The security concern involves the use of hard-coded credentials within a product, either for inbound or outbound authentication. This can lead to significant risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised system integrity. Inbound hard-coded credentials can result in default accounts with simple passwords that are difficult to change, while outbound hard-coded credentials can expose sensitive back-end service access details that are easy to discover.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I need to save an image file from a url using CURL and save it to a folder on my server. I've been battling with this code to no avail. Ideally I'd like to grab the image and save it as "photo1" or something. Help!

function GetImageFromUrl($link)
{
     
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 0);
    curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL,$link);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    $result = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    return $result;
}
    
$sourcecode = GetImageFromUrl($iticon);
$savefile = fopen(' /img/uploads/' . $iconfilename, 'w');
fwrite($savefile, $sourcecode);
fclose($savefile);"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architectural Design:**
   - Store outbound authentication credentials in a secured, encrypted configuration file or database. Use strong encryption and restrict access to authorized users only. Consider using platform-specific security features like Windows EFS.
   - Implement a "first login" mechanism to allow users to set a unique, strong password or key, avoiding hard-coded defaults.
   - If hard-coded credentials must remain, restrict access to the feature requiring them, ensuring it is only accessible through secured channels.
   - Use strong, one-way hashes with unique salts for inbound authentication credentials, storing hashed passwords rather than plain text.
   - For front-end to back-end connections, use frequently changing generated credentials stored securely, restrict backend actions to necessary operations, and employ message tagging with checksums to prevent replay attacks.

**Output Format:**  
The solution must be provided as a single and complete code snippet.
