#### Objective
Address the security risk posed by the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms, known as CWE-327. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data unexpectedly, or spoof identities. This issue is especially challenging in hardware deployment due to difficulty in updating flawed algorithms.

#### Problem Statement
"I need to save an image file from a url using CURL and save it to a folder on my server. I've been battling with this code to no avail. Ideally I'd like to grab the image and save it as "photo1" or something. Help!

function GetImageFromUrl($link)
{
     
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 0);
    curl_setopt($ch,CURLOPT_URL,$link);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    $result = curl_exec($ch);
    curl_close($ch);
    return $result;
}
    
$sourcecode = GetImageFromUrl($iticon);
$savefile = fopen(' /img/uploads/' . $iconfilename, 'w');
fwrite($savefile, $sourcecode);
fclose($savefile);"

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Adopt Strong Algorithms:**
   - Use current, strong cryptographic algorithms vetted by experts, like AES or RSA, and adhere to standards such as FIPS 140-2.
   - Avoid custom or private algorithms to prevent easy exploitation by attackers.

2. **Periodic Review and Flexibility:**
   - Periodically review cryptographic implementations to ensure they remain secure.
   - Design systems to allow easy replacement of outdated algorithms, using uniform interfaces and wrappers where possible.

3. **Key Management:**
   - Protect cryptographic keys to ensure the overall strength of the cryptography.

4. **Use Reliable Libraries:**
   - Implement cryptographic operations using vetted libraries or frameworks, such as ESAPI, to reduce the risk of errors.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Follow industry-standard practices meticulously, ensuring all recommended steps are implemented without compromise.
