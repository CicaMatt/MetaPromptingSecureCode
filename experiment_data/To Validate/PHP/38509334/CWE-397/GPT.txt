**Objective:**  
The security concern involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception such as Exception or Throwable. This practice can obscure specific error handling and recovery processes, as it hinders the development of precise handling strategies for known issues. By using generic exceptions, the system's ability to anticipate specific problems is reduced, leading to vague error management and potential vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I don't know if this going to happen, but I will try it.

For past hour I did research on image upload safety. I learned that there a lot of functions to test the upload.

In my project, I need to be safe with images uploaded. There also may be a really big amount of it and it may require a lot of bandwidth, so buying an API is not an option.

So I decided to get a full PHP script for REALLY secure image upload. I also think it will help for many of people out there, because it's impossible to find really secure one. But I am not expert in php, so it's really headache for me to add some functions, so I will ask for this community help to create one full script of REALLY secure image upload.

Really great topics about that are here (however, they are just telling what is needed to do the trick, but not how to do this, and as I said I am not a master on PHP, so I am not able to do this all by myself): PHP image upload security check list https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32852/risks-of-a-php-image-upload-form

In summary, they are telling that this is what is needed for security image upload (I will quote from the above pages):

Disable PHP from running inside the upload folder using .httaccess.
Do not allow upload if the file name contains string "php".
Allow only extensions: jpg,jpeg,gif and png.
Allow only image file type.
Disallow image with two file type.
Change the image name. Upload to a sub-directory not root directory.
Also:

Re-process the image using GD (or Imagick) and save the processed image. All others are just fun boring for hackers"
As rr pointed out, use move_uploaded_file() for any upload"
By the way, you'd want to be very restrictive about your upload folder. Those places are one of the dark corners where many exploits
happen. This is valid for any type of upload and any programming
language/server. Check
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Unrestricted_File_Upload
Level 1: Check the extension (extension file ends with)
Level 2: Check the MIME type ($file_info = getimagesize($_FILES['image_file']; $file_mime = $file_info['mime'];)
Level 3: Read first 100 bytes and check if they have any bytes in the following range: ASCII 0-8, 12-31 (decimal).
Level 4: Check for magic numbers in the header (first 10-20 bytes of the file). You can find some of the files header bytes from here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_%28programming%29#Examples
You might want to run "is_uploaded_file" on the $_FILES['my_files']['tmp_name'] as well. See
http://php.net/manual/en/function.is-uploaded-file.php
Here's a big part of it, but still that's not all. (If you know something more which could help to make the upload even safier, please share.)

THIS IS WHAT WE GOT NOW

Main PHP:

function uploadFile ($file_field = null, $check_image = false, $random_name = false) {

//Config Section    
//Set file upload path
$path = 'uploads/'; //with trailing slash
//Set max file size in bytes
$max_size = 1000000;
//Set default file extension whitelist
$whitelist_ext = array('jpeg','jpg','png','gif');
//Set default file type whitelist
$whitelist_type = array('image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png','image/gif');

//The Validation
// Create an array to hold any output
$out = array('error'=>null);

if (!$file_field) {
  $out['error'][] = "Please specify a valid form field name";           
}

if (!$path) {
  $out['error'][] = "Please specify a valid upload path";               
}

if (count($out['error'])>0) {
  return $out;
}

//Make sure that there is a file
if((!empty($_FILES[$file_field])) && ($_FILES[$file_field]['error'] == 0)) {

// Get filename
$file_info = pathinfo($_FILES[$file_field]['name']);
$name = $file_info['filename'];
$ext = $file_info['extension'];

//Check file has the right extension           
if (!in_array($ext, $whitelist_ext)) {
  $out['error'][] = "Invalid file Extension";
}

//Check that the file is of the right type
if (!in_array($_FILES[$file_field]["type"], $whitelist_type)) {
  $out['error'][] = "Invalid file Type";
}

//Check that the file is not too big
if ($_FILES[$file_field]["size"] > $max_size) {
  $out['error'][] = "File is too big";
}

//If $check image is set as true
if ($check_image) {
  if (!getimagesize($_FILES[$file_field]['tmp_name'])) {
    $out['error'][] = "Uploaded file is not a valid image";
  }
}

//Create full filename including path
if ($random_name) {
  // Generate random filename
  $tmp = str_replace(array('.',' '), array('',''), microtime());

  if (!$tmp || $tmp == '') {
    $out['error'][] = "File must have a name";
  }     
  $newname = $tmp.'.'.$ext;                                
} else {
    $newname = $name.'.'.$ext;
}

//Check if file already exists on server
if (file_exists($path.$newname)) {
  $out['error'][] = "A file with this name already exists";
}

if (count($out['error'])>0) {
  //The file has not correctly validated
  return $out;
} 

if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES[$file_field]['tmp_name'], $path.$newname)) {
  //Success
  $out['filepath'] = $path;
  $out['filename'] = $newname;
  return $out;
} else {
  $out['error'][] = "Server Error!";
}

 } else {
  $out['error'][] = "No file uploaded";
  return $out;
 }      
}


if (isset($_POST['submit'])) {
 $file = uploadFile('file', true, true);
 if (is_array($file['error'])) {
  $message = '';
  foreach ($file['error'] as $msg) {
  $message .= '<p>'.$msg.'</p>';    
 }
} else {
 $message = "File uploaded successfully".$newname;
}
 echo $message;
}
And the form:

<form action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data" name="form1" id="form1">
<input name="file" type="file" id="imagee" />
<input name="submit" type="submit" value="Upload" />
</form>
So, what I am asking is to help by posting snippets of codes which will help me (and everyone else) to make this Image Upload Script to make super secure. Or by sharing/creating a full script with all the snippets added."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Use Specific Exceptions:** Declare specific exceptions that accurately represent the error conditions that may occur. This ensures that calling methods can implement precise error handling strategies.
2. **Provide Contextual Information:** Whenever throwing exceptions, include detailed context about the error condition to aid diagnostics and recovery.
3. **Maintain Hierarchical Exception Structure:** Use custom exception classes that extend from Java's exception hierarchy, enabling more informative error handling workflows.
4. **Implement Error Logging:** Adopt structured logging for errors to ensure comprehensive tracking and analysis of exception events.

**Output Format:**  
The solution should be provided as a single and complete code snippet.
