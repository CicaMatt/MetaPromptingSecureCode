**Objective:**  
The security concern involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception such as Exception or Throwable. This practice can obscure specific error handling and recovery processes, as it hinders the development of precise handling strategies for known issues. By using generic exceptions, the system's ability to anticipate specific problems is reduced, leading to vague error management and potential vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement:**  
"In PHP 8.2, Dynamic Properties are deprecated, and will result in a fatal error from PHP 9 onwards.

Using Dynamic Properties on Classes running PHP 8.2 will lead to PHP Deprecated: Creation of dynamic property is deprecated E_DEPRECATED warnings.

Now, while this is generally a bad OO practice to have public/dynamic properties in a Class, this question is not about the best OO practice but instead, how to make actual code that uses Dynamic Properties compatible with PHP 8.2 onwards.

How to make actual codebases that make use of Dynamic Properties compatible with the new behaviour?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Use Specific Exceptions:** Declare specific exceptions that accurately represent the error conditions that may occur. This ensures that calling methods can implement precise error handling strategies.
2. **Provide Contextual Information:** Whenever throwing exceptions, include detailed context about the error condition to aid diagnostics and recovery.
3. **Maintain Hierarchical Exception Structure:** Use custom exception classes that extend from Java's exception hierarchy, enabling more informative error handling workflows.
4. **Implement Error Logging:** Adopt structured logging for errors to ensure comprehensive tracking and analysis of exception events.

**Output Format:**  
The solution should be provided as a single and complete code snippet.

**Solution Language:**
