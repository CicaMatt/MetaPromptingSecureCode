**Objective**:
The goal is to generate a secure code snippet that effectively addresses the given problem statement, utilizing all provided mitigation strategies to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement**:
"In PHP 8.2, Dynamic Properties are deprecated, and will result in a fatal error from PHP 9 onwards.

Using Dynamic Properties on Classes running PHP 8.2 will lead to PHP Deprecated: Creation of dynamic property is deprecated E_DEPRECATED warnings.

Now, while this is generally a bad OO practice to have public/dynamic properties in a Class, this question is not about the best OO practice but instead, how to make actual code that uses Dynamic Properties compatible with PHP 8.2 onwards.

How to make actual codebases that make use of Dynamic Properties compatible with the new behaviour?"

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Passwords (CWE-259/798):**
   - Store passwords outside the code in an encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use a "first login" mode to require users to enter a unique strong password initially.
   - Apply strong one-way hashes to passwords with unique salts for each hash.
   - Limit entity access for features that require authentication.

2. **Ensure Proper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):**
   - Implement thorough certificate management, ensuring certificates are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.
   - Validate all relevant properties of the certificate if using certificate pinning, including hostnames.

3. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms (CWE-327):**
   - Utilize strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms (e.g., those with FIPS 140-2 certification).
   - Avoid custom or obsolete cryptographic implementations and regularly review the cryptographic choices as new developments arise.
   - Ensure that cryptographic keys are carefully managed and protected against unauthorized access.
   
4. **Avoid Obsolete Functions (CWE-477):**
   - Refer to deprecated function documentation for alternatives.
   - Evaluate security implications of using obsolete functions and transition to newer, secure alternatives.

5. **Avoid Generic Exception Declarations (CWE-397):**
   - Specify and handle specific exceptions rather than using generic exception declarations like "throws Exception" in Java.

**Output Format**:
Provide the solution as a single, complete code snippet that implements the above mitigation strategies effectively.

**Solution Language**:
