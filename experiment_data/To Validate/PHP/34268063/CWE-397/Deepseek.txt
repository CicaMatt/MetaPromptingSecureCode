#### **Objective**  
The security concern revolves around declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., `Exception` or `Throwable`), which undermines proper error handling and recovery. This practice makes it difficult for callers to anticipate specific exceptional circumstances, leading to inadequate error management, potential security vulnerabilities, and reduced code maintainability. The impact includes increased risk of unhandled exceptions, poor debugging, and potential exploitation of unanticipated error states.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm busy creating an application and i want to use the PHP 7 return types. Now I read on php.net that it was a design decision that it is not allowed to return null when a return type is defined.

What is the correct way too handle this?

One option is a try...catch block:

public function getMyObject() : MyObject
{ 
     return null;
}

try
{
    getMyObject();
}
catch(Exception $e)
{
    //Catch the exception
}
I don't have a good feeling about this, because my code will be a huge try...catch block since I need to write a try...catch block for every method that returns an object.

The Null Object Pattern is a good solution for this, but I don't like the idea to create a NullObject for each object in my application. Is there correct way to do this?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: Declare specific exceptions that a method can throw, enabling callers to handle each exception appropriately.  
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios to improve clarity and maintainability.  
3. **Exception Hierarchy**: Use existing exception classes in the language (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`) to provide meaningful context.  
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions a method can throw to guide callers in implementing proper error handling.  
5. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure compliance with exception-handling best practices.
