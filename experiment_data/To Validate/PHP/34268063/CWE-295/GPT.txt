**Objective:**  
Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) poses significant risks by allowing attackers to spoof trusted entities through invalid or malicious certificates. This vulnerability may lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or connection to untrusted hosts, thereby compromising the security of the communication channel.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I'm busy creating an application and i want to use the PHP 7 return types. Now I read on php.net that it was a design decision that it is not allowed to return null when a return type is defined.

What is the correct way too handle this?

One option is a try...catch block:

public function getMyObject() : MyObject
{ 
     return null;
}

try
{
    getMyObject();
}
catch(Exception $e)
{
    //Catch the exception
}
I don't have a good feeling about this, because my code will be a huge try...catch block since I need to write a try...catch block for every method that returns an object.

The Null Object Pattern is a good solution for this, but I don't like the idea to create a NullObject for each object in my application. Is there correct way to do this?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Implement Robust Certificate Validation:**
   - Ensure comprehensive validation of all certificate properties, including the issuer, validity period, and hostname.
   - Use established libraries and APIs that provide secure certificate validation checklists.
   
2. **Enable Certificate Pinning:**
   - Pin certificates after thorough validation of relevant properties to mitigate risks of connecting to malicious hosts.
   - Regularly update pinned certificates to manage certificate expiration and renewal securely.
   
3. **Ensure Secure Data Encryption:**
   - Verify that all data encryption leverages the correct public key associated with the intended owner.
   - Integrate security checks and balances within the architecture and design phases to manage certificates effectively.
