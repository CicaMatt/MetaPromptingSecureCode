#### **Objective**  
Improper certificate validation can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker spoofs a trusted entity, intercepts sensitive data, or deceives the system into accepting malicious data. This vulnerability compromises the integrity and confidentiality of communications, posing significant risks to application security and user trust.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm busy creating an application and i want to use the PHP 7 return types. Now I read on php.net that it was a design decision that it is not allowed to return null when a return type is defined.

What is the correct way too handle this?

One option is a try...catch block:

public function getMyObject() : MyObject
{ 
     return null;
}

try
{
    getMyObject();
}
catch(Exception $e)
{
    //Catch the exception
}
I don't have a good feeling about this, because my code will be a huge try...catch block since I need to write a try...catch block for every method that returns an object.

The Null Object Pattern is a good solution for this, but I don't like the idea to create a NullObject for each object in my application. Is there correct way to do this?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Certificate Management**:  
   - Ensure certificates are carefully managed and validated to confirm they are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  
   - Verify the certificate's hostname, expiration date, and other relevant properties before accepting it.  

2. **Certificate Pinning**:  
   - If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant properties of the certificate (e.g., hostname, public key, and issuer) before pinning.  
   - Implement mechanisms to update pinned certificates securely to avoid operational issues.  

3. **Secure Communication Protocols**:  
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and enforce strict validation rules to prevent downgrade attacks.  

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - Implement robust error handling to reject invalid or untrusted certificates and log such events for monitoring and auditing.
