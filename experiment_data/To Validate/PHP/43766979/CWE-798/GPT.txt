**Objective:**  
The security concern involves the use of hard-coded credentials within a product, either for inbound or outbound authentication. This can lead to significant risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised system integrity. Inbound hard-coded credentials can result in default accounts with simple passwords that are difficult to change, while outbound hard-coded credentials can expose sensitive back-end service access details that are easy to discover.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architectural Design:**
   - Store outbound authentication credentials in a secured, encrypted configuration file or database. Use strong encryption and restrict access to authorized users only. Consider using platform-specific security features like Windows EFS.
   - Implement a "first login" mechanism to allow users to set a unique, strong password or key, avoiding hard-coded defaults.
   - If hard-coded credentials must remain, restrict access to the feature requiring them, ensuring it is only accessible through secured channels.
   - Use strong, one-way hashes with unique salts for inbound authentication credentials, storing hashed passwords rather than plain text.
   - For front-end to back-end connections, use frequently changing generated credentials stored securely, restrict backend actions to necessary operations, and employ message tagging with checksums to prevent replay attacks.
