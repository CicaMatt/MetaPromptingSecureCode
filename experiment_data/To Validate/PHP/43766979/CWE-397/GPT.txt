**Objective:**  
The security concern involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception such as Exception or Throwable. This practice can obscure specific error handling and recovery processes, as it hinders the development of precise handling strategies for known issues. By using generic exceptions, the system's ability to anticipate specific problems is reduced, leading to vague error management and potential vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Use Specific Exceptions:** Declare specific exceptions that accurately represent the error conditions that may occur. This ensures that calling methods can implement precise error handling strategies.
2. **Provide Contextual Information:** Whenever throwing exceptions, include detailed context about the error condition to aid diagnostics and recovery.
3. **Maintain Hierarchical Exception Structure:** Use custom exception classes that extend from Java's exception hierarchy, enabling more informative error handling workflows.
4. **Implement Error Logging:** Adopt structured logging for errors to ensure comprehensive tracking and analysis of exception events.

**Output Format:**  
The solution should be provided as a single and complete code snippet.
