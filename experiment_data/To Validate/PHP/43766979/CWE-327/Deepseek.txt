#### **Objective**  
The use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and identity spoofing. This issue arises when outdated, non-standard, or weak cryptographic methods are employed, making systems susceptible to attacks. The objective is to ensure the implementation of secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Use Strong, Up-to-Date Algorithms**: Replace outdated or weak algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, DES) with modern, vetted cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256, SHA-256, or SHA-3.  
2. **Leverage Vetted Libraries**: Utilize well-tested cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BouncyCastle, or language-specific libraries) to avoid implementation errors.  
3. **Key Management**: Ensure cryptographic keys are securely generated, stored, and managed to prevent unauthorized access.  
4. **Algorithm Agility**: Design systems to allow easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms as stronger alternatives become available.  
5. **Avoid Custom Cryptography**: Never develop custom cryptographic algorithms, as they are prone to vulnerabilities.  
6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with current security standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
