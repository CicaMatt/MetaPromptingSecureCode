**Objective:** Improper certificate validation exposes systems to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate trusted entities, intercept sensitive data, and potentially inject malicious code. This can compromise data confidentiality and integrity, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and reputational damage.

**Problem Statement:**  "I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Validate all relevant certificate properties:** Ensure that the certificate chain, hostname, expiration date, and issuer are thoroughly validated before accepting the certificate.
* **Avoid disabling certificate validation:**  Disabling certificate validation completely eliminates security benefits and should never be done in production environments.
* **Implement certificate pinning cautiously:** If certificate pinning is used, rigorously validate all certificate details before pinning to prevent future validation issues.  Ensure the pinned certificate is updated appropriately when it expires.
* **Use trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs):**  Whenever possible, use certificates issued by reputable and trusted CAs.
* **Keep certificate stores updated:** Regularly update certificate stores to include the latest root and intermediate certificates.
