**Objective:**  
The primary security concern is the use of hard-coded passwords in a software product, which can lead to significant authentication failures. These weaknesses can result in unauthorized access, exploitation, and potential system compromise, affecting system integrity and security. Hard-coded passwords are difficult to detect, challenging to fix, and can potentially force disabling of the product if publicized.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architecture and Design Phase:**
   - **Outbound Authentication:**
     - Store passwords in a securely encrypted configuration file or database, ensuring protection from unauthorized access.
     - Protect the encryption key with appropriate security measures (CWE-320).
   - **Inbound Authentication:**
     - Implement a "first login" mode to prompt users to create a unique, strong password.
     - Apply strong one-way hashing to passwords, storing hashes with proper access control. Use per-user salting to enhance security against brute-force attacks.
   - **Access Control:**
     - Enforce strict access control checks, limiting feature access that requires authenticating with hard-coded passwords.
   - **Front-end to Back-end Connections:**
     - Utilize generated passwords that change automatically and require periodic manual entry by a system administrator.
     - Limit front-end granted actions on the back-end system.
     - Implement message tagging and checksumming to prevent replay attacks.

The solution must be generated as a single and complete code snippet.
