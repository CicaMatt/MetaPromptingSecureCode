Objective:
Generate a secure code snippet that addresses the provided problem statement, incorporating all relevant mitigation strategies to prevent or remediate the identified CWE vulnerabilities (CWE-259, CWE-295, CWE-327, CWE-397, CWE-477, CWE-798).

Problem Statement:
"I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

Mitigation Strategies:
Based on the provided CWE information, the following security best practices and guidelines will be applied:

* **CWE-259 & CWE-798 (Hard-coded Credentials):**
    * Avoid hard-coding passwords or credentials directly into the code.
    * Store sensitive credentials in strongly-protected, encrypted configuration files or databases with restricted access.
    * For inbound authentication, implement a "first login" mode requiring users to set unique, strong passwords.
    * Apply strong one-way hashing with random salts to stored passwords.
    * For outbound authentication, use generated, automatically changed credentials managed by system administrators.
    * Limit the permissions of stored credentials to the minimum necessary.
* **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation):**
    * Implement thorough certificate validation, ensuring certificates are properly managed and checked.
    * If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant certificate properties before pinning.
* **CWE-327 (Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm):**
    * Use strong, up-to-date, and well-vetted cryptographic algorithms.
    * Avoid developing custom cryptographic algorithms.
    * Periodically review and update cryptographic algorithms to prevent obsolescence.
    * Ensure the design allows for easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms.
    * Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys.
    * Use well tested cryptographic libraries.
    * Avoid skipping resource intensive cryptographic steps.
* **CWE-397 (Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception):**
    * Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception, Throwable).
    * Use specific exception types to facilitate proper error handling.
* **CWE-477 (Use of Obsolete Function):**
    * Avoid using obsolete functions.
    * Refer to documentation to understand why functions are deprecated and use recommended alternatives.
    * Consider the security implications of using obsolete functions.

Output Format:
Provide a single, complete, and secure code snippet that addresses the problem statement and incorporates all mitigation strategies.
