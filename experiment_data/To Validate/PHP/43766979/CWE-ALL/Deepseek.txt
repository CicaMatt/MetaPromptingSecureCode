#### **Problem Statement**  
"I want to write a program with database connectivity and exception handling in PHP. If I insert an incorrect username then it should display its corresponding error message, and if I insert the incorrect database it should display its corresponding error message.

But in the following program whether I insert incorrect database or incorrect username it only displays the message "Could not connect to database".

<?php
   $hostname = "localhost";
   $username = "root1";
   $password = "";
   $database = "php_thenewboston";
   $conn = mysqli_connect($hostname,$username,$password);
   $conn_db = mysqli_select_db($conn,$database);
   class ServerException extends Exception{}  
   class DatabaseException extends Exception{}
   try{
       if(!$conn){
           throw new ServerException('Could not connect to server.');
       }elseif(!$conn_db){
           throw new DatabaseException('Could not connect to database.');
       }else{
           echo "Connected.";
       }
   }catch(ServerException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();        
   }catch(DatabaseException $ex){
       echo "Error :".$ex->getMessage();
   }
?>
I am a beginner in PHP. Please comment below for any query."

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Credentials**:  
   - Store credentials (e.g., passwords, keys) outside the code in a strongly protected, encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults for credential management.
   - Ensure proper access control and encryption for stored credentials.

2. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms**:  
   - Employ up-to-date, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256).
   - Avoid deprecated or broken algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1).
   - Use randomly generated salts for password hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.

3. **Implement Secure Authentication Mechanisms**:  
   - For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique strong password during first login.
   - For outbound authentication, use dynamically generated credentials with limited validity periods.
   - Validate certificates fully (e.g., hostname, expiration) when using certificate pinning.

4. **Prevent Generic Exception Handling**:  
   - Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception or Throwable).
   - Use specific exception types to enable proper error handling and recovery.

5. **Avoid Obsolete Functions**:  
   - Replace deprecated or obsolete functions with their modern, secure counterparts.
   - Refer to language documentation for recommended alternatives.
