**Objective:**  
The primary security concern is the use of hard-coded passwords in a software product, which can lead to significant authentication failures. These weaknesses can result in unauthorized access, exploitation, and potential system compromise, affecting system integrity and security. Hard-coded passwords are difficult to detect, challenging to fix, and can potentially force disabling of the product if publicized.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I am new to using prepared statements in mysql with php. I need some help creating a prepared statement to retrieve columns.

I need to get information from different columns. Currently for a test file, I use the completely unsecure SQL statement:

$qry = "SELECT * FROM mytable where userid='{$_GET['userid']}' AND category='{$_GET['category']}'ORDER BY id DESC"
$result = mysql_query($qry) or die(mysql_error()); 
Can someone help me create a secure mysql statement using input from url parameters (as above) that is prepared?

BONUS: Prepared statements are suppose to increase speed as well. Will it increase overall speed if I only use a prepared statement three or four times on a page?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architecture and Design Phase:**
   - **Outbound Authentication:**
     - Store passwords in a securely encrypted configuration file or database, ensuring protection from unauthorized access.
     - Protect the encryption key with appropriate security measures (CWE-320).
   - **Inbound Authentication:**
     - Implement a "first login" mode to prompt users to create a unique, strong password.
     - Apply strong one-way hashing to passwords, storing hashes with proper access control. Use per-user salting to enhance security against brute-force attacks.
   - **Access Control:**
     - Enforce strict access control checks, limiting feature access that requires authenticating with hard-coded passwords.
   - **Front-end to Back-end Connections:**
     - Utilize generated passwords that change automatically and require periodic manual entry by a system administrator.
     - Limit front-end granted actions on the back-end system.
     - Implement message tagging and checksumming to prevent replay attacks.

**Output Format:**  
The solution must be generated as a single and complete code snippet.

**Solution Language:**
