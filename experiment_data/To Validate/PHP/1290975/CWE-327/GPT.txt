#### Objective
Address the security risk posed by the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms, known as CWE-327. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data unexpectedly, or spoof identities. This issue is especially challenging in hardware deployment due to difficulty in updating flawed algorithms.

#### Problem Statement
"I am new to using prepared statements in mysql with php. I need some help creating a prepared statement to retrieve columns.

I need to get information from different columns. Currently for a test file, I use the completely unsecure SQL statement:

$qry = "SELECT * FROM mytable where userid='{$_GET['userid']}' AND category='{$_GET['category']}'ORDER BY id DESC"
$result = mysql_query($qry) or die(mysql_error()); 
Can someone help me create a secure mysql statement using input from url parameters (as above) that is prepared?

BONUS: Prepared statements are suppose to increase speed as well. Will it increase overall speed if I only use a prepared statement three or four times on a page?"

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Adopt Strong Algorithms:**
   - Use current, strong cryptographic algorithms vetted by experts, like AES or RSA, and adhere to standards such as FIPS 140-2.
   - Avoid custom or private algorithms to prevent easy exploitation by attackers.

2. **Periodic Review and Flexibility:**
   - Periodically review cryptographic implementations to ensure they remain secure.
   - Design systems to allow easy replacement of outdated algorithms, using uniform interfaces and wrappers where possible.

3. **Key Management:**
   - Protect cryptographic keys to ensure the overall strength of the cryptography.

4. **Use Reliable Libraries:**
   - Implement cryptographic operations using vetted libraries or frameworks, such as ESAPI, to reduce the risk of errors.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Follow industry-standard practices meticulously, ensuring all recommended steps are implemented without compromise.
