**Objective:**  
The security concern involves the use of hard-coded credentials within a product, either for inbound or outbound authentication. This can lead to significant risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised system integrity. Inbound hard-coded credentials can result in default accounts with simple passwords that are difficult to change, while outbound hard-coded credentials can expose sensitive back-end service access details that are easy to discover.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I am new to using prepared statements in mysql with php. I need some help creating a prepared statement to retrieve columns.

I need to get information from different columns. Currently for a test file, I use the completely unsecure SQL statement:

$qry = "SELECT * FROM mytable where userid='{$_GET['userid']}' AND category='{$_GET['category']}'ORDER BY id DESC"
$result = mysql_query($qry) or die(mysql_error()); 
Can someone help me create a secure mysql statement using input from url parameters (as above) that is prepared?

BONUS: Prepared statements are suppose to increase speed as well. Will it increase overall speed if I only use a prepared statement three or four times on a page?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architectural Design:**
   - Store outbound authentication credentials in a secured, encrypted configuration file or database. Use strong encryption and restrict access to authorized users only. Consider using platform-specific security features like Windows EFS.
   - Implement a "first login" mechanism to allow users to set a unique, strong password or key, avoiding hard-coded defaults.
   - If hard-coded credentials must remain, restrict access to the feature requiring them, ensuring it is only accessible through secured channels.
   - Use strong, one-way hashes with unique salts for inbound authentication credentials, storing hashed passwords rather than plain text.
   - For front-end to back-end connections, use frequently changing generated credentials stored securely, restrict backend actions to necessary operations, and employ message tagging with checksums to prevent replay attacks.

**Output Format:**  
The solution must be provided as a single and complete code snippet.
