**Objective:** Improper certificate validation exposes systems to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate trusted entities, intercept sensitive data, and potentially inject malicious code. This can compromise data confidentiality and integrity, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and reputational damage.

**Problem Statement:**  "I have a PHP 5.1.0 website (actually it's 5.2.9 but it must also run on 5.1.0+).

Pages are generated dynamically but many of them are mostly static. By static I mean the content don't change but the "template" around the content can change over time.

I know they are several cache systems and PHP frameworks already out there, but my host don't have APC or Memcached installed and I'm not using any framework for this particular project.

I want the pages to be cached (I think by default PHP "disallow" cache). So far I'm using:

session_cache_limiter('private'); //Aim at 'public'
session_cache_expire(180);
header("Content-type: $documentMimeType; charset=$documentCharset");
header('Vary: Accept');
header("Content-language: $currentLanguage");
I read many tutorials but I can't find something simple (I know cache is something complex, but I only need some basic stuff).

What are "must" have headers to send to help caching?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Validate all relevant certificate properties:** Ensure that the certificate chain, hostname, expiration date, and issuer are thoroughly validated before accepting the certificate.
* **Avoid disabling certificate validation:**  Disabling certificate validation completely eliminates security benefits and should never be done in production environments.
* **Implement certificate pinning cautiously:** If certificate pinning is used, rigorously validate all certificate details before pinning to prevent future validation issues.  Ensure the pinned certificate is updated appropriately when it expires.
* **Use trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs):**  Whenever possible, use certificates issued by reputable and trusted CAs.
* **Keep certificate stores updated:** Regularly update certificate stores to include the latest root and intermediate certificates.


**Output Format:**  The solution must be a single, complete, and runnable code snippet that directly addresses the described problem.
