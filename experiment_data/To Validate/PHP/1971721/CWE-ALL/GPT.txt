**Objective**:
The goal is to generate a secure code snippet that effectively addresses the given problem statement, utilizing all provided mitigation strategies to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement**:
"I have a PHP 5.1.0 website (actually it's 5.2.9 but it must also run on 5.1.0+).

Pages are generated dynamically but many of them are mostly static. By static I mean the content don't change but the "template" around the content can change over time.

I know they are several cache systems and PHP frameworks already out there, but my host don't have APC or Memcached installed and I'm not using any framework for this particular project.

I want the pages to be cached (I think by default PHP "disallow" cache). So far I'm using:

session_cache_limiter('private'); //Aim at 'public'
session_cache_expire(180);
header("Content-type: $documentMimeType; charset=$documentCharset");
header('Vary: Accept');
header("Content-language: $currentLanguage");
I read many tutorials but I can't find something simple (I know cache is something complex, but I only need some basic stuff).

What are "must" have headers to send to help caching?"

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Passwords (CWE-259/798):**
   - Store passwords outside the code in an encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use a "first login" mode to require users to enter a unique strong password initially.
   - Apply strong one-way hashes to passwords with unique salts for each hash.
   - Limit entity access for features that require authentication.

2. **Ensure Proper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):**
   - Implement thorough certificate management, ensuring certificates are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.
   - Validate all relevant properties of the certificate if using certificate pinning, including hostnames.

3. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms (CWE-327):**
   - Utilize strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms (e.g., those with FIPS 140-2 certification).
   - Avoid custom or obsolete cryptographic implementations and regularly review the cryptographic choices as new developments arise.
   - Ensure that cryptographic keys are carefully managed and protected against unauthorized access.
   
4. **Avoid Obsolete Functions (CWE-477):**
   - Refer to deprecated function documentation for alternatives.
   - Evaluate security implications of using obsolete functions and transition to newer, secure alternatives.

5. **Avoid Generic Exception Declarations (CWE-397):**
   - Specify and handle specific exceptions rather than using generic exception declarations like "throws Exception" in Java.

**Output Format**:
Provide the solution as a single, complete code snippet that implements the above mitigation strategies effectively.

**Solution Language**:
