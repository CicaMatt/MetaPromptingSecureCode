Objective:
Generate a secure code snippet that addresses the provided problem statement, incorporating all relevant mitigation strategies to prevent or remediate the identified CWE vulnerabilities (CWE-259, CWE-295, CWE-327, CWE-397, CWE-477, CWE-798).

Problem Statement:
"I have a PHP 5.1.0 website (actually it's 5.2.9 but it must also run on 5.1.0+).

Pages are generated dynamically but many of them are mostly static. By static I mean the content don't change but the "template" around the content can change over time.

I know they are several cache systems and PHP frameworks already out there, but my host don't have APC or Memcached installed and I'm not using any framework for this particular project.

I want the pages to be cached (I think by default PHP "disallow" cache). So far I'm using:

session_cache_limiter('private'); //Aim at 'public'
session_cache_expire(180);
header("Content-type: $documentMimeType; charset=$documentCharset");
header('Vary: Accept');
header("Content-language: $currentLanguage");
I read many tutorials but I can't find something simple (I know cache is something complex, but I only need some basic stuff).

What are "must" have headers to send to help caching?"

Mitigation Strategies:
Based on the provided CWE information, the following security best practices and guidelines will be applied:

* **CWE-259 & CWE-798 (Hard-coded Credentials):**
    * Avoid hard-coding passwords or credentials directly into the code.
    * Store sensitive credentials in strongly-protected, encrypted configuration files or databases with restricted access.
    * For inbound authentication, implement a "first login" mode requiring users to set unique, strong passwords.
    * Apply strong one-way hashing with random salts to stored passwords.
    * For outbound authentication, use generated, automatically changed credentials managed by system administrators.
    * Limit the permissions of stored credentials to the minimum necessary.
* **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation):**
    * Implement thorough certificate validation, ensuring certificates are properly managed and checked.
    * If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant certificate properties before pinning.
* **CWE-327 (Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm):**
    * Use strong, up-to-date, and well-vetted cryptographic algorithms.
    * Avoid developing custom cryptographic algorithms.
    * Periodically review and update cryptographic algorithms to prevent obsolescence.
    * Ensure the design allows for easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms.
    * Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys.
    * Use well tested cryptographic libraries.
    * Avoid skipping resource intensive cryptographic steps.
* **CWE-397 (Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception):**
    * Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception, Throwable).
    * Use specific exception types to facilitate proper error handling.
* **CWE-477 (Use of Obsolete Function):**
    * Avoid using obsolete functions.
    * Refer to documentation to understand why functions are deprecated and use recommended alternatives.
    * Consider the security implications of using obsolete functions.

Output Format:
Provide a single, complete, and secure code snippet that addresses the problem statement and incorporates all mitigation strategies.
