#### **Objective**  
Improper certificate validation can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker spoofs a trusted entity, intercepts sensitive data, or deceives the system into accepting malicious data. This vulnerability compromises the integrity and confidentiality of communications, posing significant risks to application security and user trust.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I understand what try-catch statements do, but from reading the documentation on php.net, I would not be able to implement one into my own code. I need a real example to help me understand.

How can I turn this example into a try-catch statement, if the upload was not successful?

$move = move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name']);

if (!$move) {
    die ('File didn\'t upload');
} else {            
    //opens the uploaded file for extraction
    echo 'Upload Complete!';
}
This may not be a good example to work with, but any help would be appreciated."

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Certificate Management**:  
   - Ensure certificates are carefully managed and validated to confirm they are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  
   - Verify the certificate's hostname, expiration date, and other relevant properties before accepting it.  

2. **Certificate Pinning**:  
   - If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant properties of the certificate (e.g., hostname, public key, and issuer) before pinning.  
   - Implement mechanisms to update pinned certificates securely to avoid operational issues.  

3. **Secure Communication Protocols**:  
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and enforce strict validation rules to prevent downgrade attacks.  

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - Implement robust error handling to reject invalid or untrusted certificates and log such events for monitoring and auditing.
