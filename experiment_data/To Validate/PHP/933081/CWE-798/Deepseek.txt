#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded credentials in software poses a significant security risk, as it allows attackers to easily gain unauthorized access to systems or sensitive data. This vulnerability can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized privilege escalation. Mitigating this issue is critical to ensuring secure authentication mechanisms and protecting sensitive information.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I understand what try-catch statements do, but from reading the documentation on php.net, I would not be able to implement one into my own code. I need a real example to help me understand.

How can I turn this example into a try-catch statement, if the upload was not successful?

$move = move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name']);

if (!$move) {
    die ('File didn\'t upload');
} else {            
    //opens the uploaded file for extraction
    echo 'Upload Complete!';
}
This may not be a good example to work with, but any help would be appreciated."

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-Coding Credentials**:  
   - Store credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) in secure, encrypted configuration files or environment variables.  
   - Use secure credential management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault.  

2. **Inbound Authentication**:  
   - Implement a "first login" mode for initial setup, requiring users to set a unique, strong password.  
   - Use strong one-way hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with unique salts for stored passwords.  

3. **Outbound Authentication**:  
   - Use dynamically generated credentials with limited validity periods.  
   - Restrict backend access to only necessary actions for the frontend system.  

4. **Access Control**:  
   - Limit access to sensitive features to trusted entities (e.g., system console only).  
   - Implement time-sensitive checksums or tags to prevent replay attacks.  

5. **Secure Storage**:  
   - Encrypt configuration files or databases storing credentials.  
   - Restrict file permissions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.
