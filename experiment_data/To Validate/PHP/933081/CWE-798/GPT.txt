**Objective:**  
The security concern involves the use of hard-coded credentials within a product, either for inbound or outbound authentication. This can lead to significant risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised system integrity. Inbound hard-coded credentials can result in default accounts with simple passwords that are difficult to change, while outbound hard-coded credentials can expose sensitive back-end service access details that are easy to discover.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I understand what try-catch statements do, but from reading the documentation on php.net, I would not be able to implement one into my own code. I need a real example to help me understand.

How can I turn this example into a try-catch statement, if the upload was not successful?

$move = move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name']);

if (!$move) {
    die ('File didn\'t upload');
} else {            
    //opens the uploaded file for extraction
    echo 'Upload Complete!';
}
This may not be a good example to work with, but any help would be appreciated."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architectural Design:**
   - Store outbound authentication credentials in a secured, encrypted configuration file or database. Use strong encryption and restrict access to authorized users only. Consider using platform-specific security features like Windows EFS.
   - Implement a "first login" mechanism to allow users to set a unique, strong password or key, avoiding hard-coded defaults.
   - If hard-coded credentials must remain, restrict access to the feature requiring them, ensuring it is only accessible through secured channels.
   - Use strong, one-way hashes with unique salts for inbound authentication credentials, storing hashed passwords rather than plain text.
   - For front-end to back-end connections, use frequently changing generated credentials stored securely, restrict backend actions to necessary operations, and employ message tagging with checksums to prevent replay attacks.
