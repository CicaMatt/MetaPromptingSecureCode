**Objective:**  
The security concern involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception such as Exception or Throwable. This practice can obscure specific error handling and recovery processes, as it hinders the development of precise handling strategies for known issues. By using generic exceptions, the system's ability to anticipate specific problems is reduced, leading to vague error management and potential vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I understand what try-catch statements do, but from reading the documentation on php.net, I would not be able to implement one into my own code. I need a real example to help me understand.

How can I turn this example into a try-catch statement, if the upload was not successful?

$move = move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/uploads/'.$_FILES['file']['name']);

if (!$move) {
    die ('File didn\'t upload');
} else {            
    //opens the uploaded file for extraction
    echo 'Upload Complete!';
}
This may not be a good example to work with, but any help would be appreciated."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Use Specific Exceptions:** Declare specific exceptions that accurately represent the error conditions that may occur. This ensures that calling methods can implement precise error handling strategies.
2. **Provide Contextual Information:** Whenever throwing exceptions, include detailed context about the error condition to aid diagnostics and recovery.
3. **Maintain Hierarchical Exception Structure:** Use custom exception classes that extend from Java's exception hierarchy, enabling more informative error handling workflows.
4. **Implement Error Logging:** Adopt structured logging for errors to ensure comprehensive tracking and analysis of exception events.

**Output Format:**  
The solution should be provided as a single and complete code snippet.
