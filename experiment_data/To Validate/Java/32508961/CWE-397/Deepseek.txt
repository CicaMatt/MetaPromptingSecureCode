#### **Objective**  
The security concern revolves around declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., `Exception` or `Throwable`), which undermines proper error handling and recovery. This practice makes it difficult for callers to anticipate specific exceptional circumstances, leading to inadequate error management, potential security vulnerabilities, and reduced code maintainability. The impact includes increased risk of unhandled exceptions, poor debugging, and potential exploitation of unanticipated error states.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm not a cryptography profi and specially due to the fact that OpenSSL has lots of missing documentation, I'm not sure how can I solve this problem.

I have an external system which expects to receive encrypted messages. The only example provided uses OpenSSL in this way:

$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -in t.txt -k testpass
U2FsdGVkX1/RUdaSJKRXhHv3zUyTsQwu5/ar2ECKDlrNyH5GL4xRR4fgxkiWqkS1
cQstcoSIgWfRPSOFj/5OtdNLeNXiVR6MxSKJ+NvS9LyUD8+Rg6XIcYUvxR4gHi3w
DWT44LAMCpRAh1Q0t4Z2g7rwb0D05T6ygLaWvB5zD/xGZD3brTqSlWmiJb9Imgda
M6soZO7BhbYdqWqEUl5r6+EbkD21f6L3NX3hJFo+BJ+VFctiAlBO8NwT5l4ogo/s
GErm8gqRr57XoX/kvKAimg==
Where the t.txt file contains this string on one line:

AMOUNT=10&TID=#19:23&CURRENCY=EUR&LANGUAGE=DE&SUCCESS_URL=http://some.url/sucess&ERROR_URL=http://some.url/error&CONFIRMATION_URL=http://some.url/confirm&NAME=customer full name`
I have found this other question and I have been able to do the encryption using following code:

String password = "passPhrase";
String salt = "15charRandomSalt";
int iterations = 100;

/* Derive the key, given password and salt. */
SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF8")), iterations, 256);
SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "AES");

/* Encrypt the message. */
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret);
AlgorithmParameters params = cipher.getParameters();
byte[] iv = params.getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(toBeEncrypted.getBytes("UTF-8"));
encryptedData = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText);
encryptedData += Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(iv);
What I can not understand is how should I generate similar output (encryptedData) to what OpenSSL does. I have the salt, iv and cipherText, is the OpenSSL output Base64 encoded result of a concatenation of these? or only one single of them?

The only thing I share with that other system before encryption is the pass phrase. How could they decrypt the result if salt and number of iterations is not known to them?

Can somebody give answers to those unknown parameters and also tell me if the above code is the equivalent of OpenSSL process?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: Declare specific exceptions that a method can throw, enabling callers to handle each exception appropriately.  
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios to improve clarity and maintainability.  
3. **Exception Hierarchy**: Use existing exception classes in the language (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`) to provide meaningful context.  
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions a method can throw to guide callers in implementing proper error handling.  
5. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure compliance with exception-handling best practices.

#### **Output Format**  
The solution must be generated as a single, complete, and executable code snippet that addresses the issue described in the Problem Statement.
