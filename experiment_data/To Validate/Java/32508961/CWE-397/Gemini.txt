**Objective:**  This vulnerability involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception (e.g., `Exception`, `Throwable` in Java) instead of specific exceptions. This practice hinders effective error handling and recovery by callers, masking the true nature of potential errors and making it difficult to implement precise exception handling logic. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, difficulties in debugging, and potentially security vulnerabilities if errors are not handled appropriately.

**Problem Statement:**  "I'm not a cryptography profi and specially due to the fact that OpenSSL has lots of missing documentation, I'm not sure how can I solve this problem.

I have an external system which expects to receive encrypted messages. The only example provided uses OpenSSL in this way:

$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -in t.txt -k testpass
U2FsdGVkX1/RUdaSJKRXhHv3zUyTsQwu5/ar2ECKDlrNyH5GL4xRR4fgxkiWqkS1
cQstcoSIgWfRPSOFj/5OtdNLeNXiVR6MxSKJ+NvS9LyUD8+Rg6XIcYUvxR4gHi3w

M6soZO7BhbYdqWqEUl5r6+EbkD21f6L3NX3hJFo+BJ+VFctiAlBO8NwT5l4ogo/s
GErm8gqRr57XoX/kvKAimg==
Where the t.txt file contains this string on one line:

AMOUNT=10&TID=#19:23&CURRENCY=EUR&LANGUAGE=DE&SUCCESS_URL=http://some.url/sucess&ERROR_URL=http://some.url/error&CONFIRMATION_URL=http://some.url/confirm&NAME=customer full name`
I have found this other question and I have been able to do the encryption using following code:

String password = "passPhrase";
String salt = "15charRandomSalt";
int iterations = 100;

/* Derive the key, given password and salt. */
SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF8")), iterations, 256);
SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "AES");

/* Encrypt the message. */
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret);
AlgorithmParameters params = cipher.getParameters();
byte[] iv = params.getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(toBeEncrypted.getBytes("UTF-8"));
encryptedData = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText);
encryptedData += Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(iv);
What I can not understand is how should I generate similar output (encryptedData) to what OpenSSL does. I have the salt, iv and cipherText, is the OpenSSL output Base64 encoded result of a concatenation of these? or only one single of them?

The only thing I share with that other system before encryption is the pass phrase. How could they decrypt the result if salt and number of iterations is not known to them?

Can somebody give answers to those unknown parameters and also tell me if the above code is the equivalent of OpenSSL process?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Identify Specific Exceptions:** Analyze the code within the method to determine the specific types of exceptions that could be thrown.  
* **Replace Generic Exception:** Replace the generic `Exception` or `Throwable` declaration in the method signature with the identified specific exception types.  If multiple exceptions are possible, list them individually separated by commas (e.g., `IOException, IllegalArgumentException`).
* **Implement Targeted Exception Handling:** In the calling code, implement `try-catch` blocks to handle each specific exception appropriately. This allows for tailored error recovery logic based on the specific nature of the error.
* **Avoid Empty Catch Blocks:** Never leave a `catch` block empty.  At a minimum, log the exception to aid in debugging.  Implement proper error handling or rethrow the exception if it cannot be handled locally.
* **Consider Custom Exceptions:** For specific error conditions unique to your application, define custom exception classes that inherit from relevant built-in exception types.


**Output Format:**  Provide a single, complete, and compilable code snippet that demonstrates the corrected method declaration and associated exception handling in the calling code.
