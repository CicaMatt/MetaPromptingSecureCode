#### **Objective**  
The use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and identity spoofing. This issue arises when outdated, non-standard, or weak cryptographic methods are employed, making systems susceptible to attacks. The objective is to ensure the implementation of secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm not a cryptography profi and specially due to the fact that OpenSSL has lots of missing documentation, I'm not sure how can I solve this problem.

I have an external system which expects to receive encrypted messages. The only example provided uses OpenSSL in this way:

$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -in t.txt -k testpass
U2FsdGVkX1/RUdaSJKRXhHv3zUyTsQwu5/ar2ECKDlrNyH5GL4xRR4fgxkiWqkS1
cQstcoSIgWfRPSOFj/5OtdNLeNXiVR6MxSKJ+NvS9LyUD8+Rg6XIcYUvxR4gHi3w
DWT44LAMCpRAh1Q0t4Z2g7rwb0D05T6ygLaWvB5zD/xGZD3brTqSlWmiJb9Imgda
M6soZO7BhbYdqWqEUl5r6+EbkD21f6L3NX3hJFo+BJ+VFctiAlBO8NwT5l4ogo/s
GErm8gqRr57XoX/kvKAimg==
Where the t.txt file contains this string on one line:

AMOUNT=10&TID=#19:23&CURRENCY=EUR&LANGUAGE=DE&SUCCESS_URL=http://some.url/sucess&ERROR_URL=http://some.url/error&CONFIRMATION_URL=http://some.url/confirm&NAME=customer full name`
I have found this other question and I have been able to do the encryption using following code:

String password = "passPhrase";
String salt = "15charRandomSalt";
int iterations = 100;

/* Derive the key, given password and salt. */
SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF8")), iterations, 256);
SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "AES");

/* Encrypt the message. */
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret);
AlgorithmParameters params = cipher.getParameters();
byte[] iv = params.getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(toBeEncrypted.getBytes("UTF-8"));
encryptedData = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText);
encryptedData += Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(iv);
What I can not understand is how should I generate similar output (encryptedData) to what OpenSSL does. I have the salt, iv and cipherText, is the OpenSSL output Base64 encoded result of a concatenation of these? or only one single of them?

The only thing I share with that other system before encryption is the pass phrase. How could they decrypt the result if salt and number of iterations is not known to them?

Can somebody give answers to those unknown parameters and also tell me if the above code is the equivalent of OpenSSL process?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Use Strong, Up-to-Date Algorithms**: Replace outdated or weak algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, DES) with modern, vetted cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256, SHA-256, or SHA-3.  
2. **Leverage Vetted Libraries**: Utilize well-tested cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BouncyCastle, or language-specific libraries) to avoid implementation errors.  
3. **Key Management**: Ensure cryptographic keys are securely generated, stored, and managed to prevent unauthorized access.  
4. **Algorithm Agility**: Design systems to allow easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms as stronger alternatives become available.  
5. **Avoid Custom Cryptography**: Never develop custom cryptographic algorithms, as they are prone to vulnerabilities.  
6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with current security standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
