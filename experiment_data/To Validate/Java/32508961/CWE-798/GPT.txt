**Objective:**  
The security concern involves the use of hard-coded credentials within a product, either for inbound or outbound authentication. This can lead to significant risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromised system integrity. Inbound hard-coded credentials can result in default accounts with simple passwords that are difficult to change, while outbound hard-coded credentials can expose sensitive back-end service access details that are easy to discover.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I'm not a cryptography profi and specially due to the fact that OpenSSL has lots of missing documentation, I'm not sure how can I solve this problem.

I have an external system which expects to receive encrypted messages. The only example provided uses OpenSSL in this way:

$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -in t.txt -k testpass
U2FsdGVkX1/RUdaSJKRXhHv3zUyTsQwu5/ar2ECKDlrNyH5GL4xRR4fgxkiWqkS1

M6soZO7BhbYdqWqEUl5r6+EbkD21f6L3NX3hJFo+BJ+VFctiAlBO8NwT5l4ogo/s
GErm8gqRr57XoX/kvKAimg==
Where the t.txt file contains this string on one line:

AMOUNT=10&TID=#19:23&CURRENCY=EUR&LANGUAGE=DE&SUCCESS_URL=http://some.url/sucess&ERROR_URL=http://some.url/error&CONFIRMATION_URL=http://some.url/confirm&NAME=customer full name`
I have found this other question and I have been able to do the encryption using following code:

String password = "passPhrase";
String salt = "15charRandomSalt";
int iterations = 100;

/* Derive the key, given password and salt. */
SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF8")), iterations, 256);
SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "AES");

/* Encrypt the message. */
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret);
AlgorithmParameters params = cipher.getParameters();
byte[] iv = params.getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(toBeEncrypted.getBytes("UTF-8"));
encryptedData = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText);
encryptedData += Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(iv);
What I can not understand is how should I generate similar output (encryptedData) to what OpenSSL does. I have the salt, iv and cipherText, is the OpenSSL output Base64 encoded result of a concatenation of these? or only one single of them?

The only thing I share with that other system before encryption is the pass phrase. How could they decrypt the result if salt and number of iterations is not known to them?

Can somebody give answers to those unknown parameters and also tell me if the above code is the equivalent of OpenSSL process?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architectural Design:**
   - Store outbound authentication credentials in a secured, encrypted configuration file or database. Use strong encryption and restrict access to authorized users only. Consider using platform-specific security features like Windows EFS.
   - Implement a "first login" mechanism to allow users to set a unique, strong password or key, avoiding hard-coded defaults.
   - If hard-coded credentials must remain, restrict access to the feature requiring them, ensuring it is only accessible through secured channels.
   - Use strong, one-way hashes with unique salts for inbound authentication credentials, storing hashed passwords rather than plain text.
   - For front-end to back-end connections, use frequently changing generated credentials stored securely, restrict backend actions to necessary operations, and employ message tagging with checksums to prevent replay attacks.

**Output Format:**  
The solution must be provided as a single and complete code snippet.
