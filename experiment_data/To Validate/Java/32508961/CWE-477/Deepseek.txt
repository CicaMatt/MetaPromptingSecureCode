#### **Objective**  
The use of obsolete functions in code poses significant security risks, including vulnerabilities to exploits, reduced maintainability, and potential non-compliance with modern security standards. Obsolete functions are often deprecated due to inherent flaws, inefficiencies, or lack of support, making them unsuitable for secure and reliable software development. Addressing this issue is critical to ensure robust, future-proof, and secure code.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm not a cryptography profi and specially due to the fact that OpenSSL has lots of missing documentation, I'm not sure how can I solve this problem.

I have an external system which expects to receive encrypted messages. The only example provided uses OpenSSL in this way:

$ openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -in t.txt -k testpass
U2FsdGVkX1/RUdaSJKRXhHv3zUyTsQwu5/ar2ECKDlrNyH5GL4xRR4fgxkiWqkS1
cQstcoSIgWfRPSOFj/5OtdNLeNXiVR6MxSKJ+NvS9LyUD8+Rg6XIcYUvxR4gHi3w
DWT44LAMCpRAh1Q0t4Z2g7rwb0D05T6ygLaWvB5zD/xGZD3brTqSlWmiJb9Imgda
M6soZO7BhbYdqWqEUl5r6+EbkD21f6L3NX3hJFo+BJ+VFctiAlBO8NwT5l4ogo/s
GErm8gqRr57XoX/kvKAimg==
Where the t.txt file contains this string on one line:

AMOUNT=10&TID=#19:23&CURRENCY=EUR&LANGUAGE=DE&SUCCESS_URL=http://some.url/sucess&ERROR_URL=http://some.url/error&CONFIRMATION_URL=http://some.url/confirm&NAME=customer full name`
I have found this other question and I have been able to do the encryption using following code:

String password = "passPhrase";
String salt = "15charRandomSalt";
int iterations = 100;

/* Derive the key, given password and salt. */
SecretKeyFactory factory = SecretKeyFactory.getInstance("PBKDF2WithHmacSHA256");
KeySpec spec = new PBEKeySpec(password.toCharArray(), salt.getBytes(Charset.forName("UTF8")), iterations, 256);
SecretKey tmp = factory.generateSecret(spec);
SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(tmp.getEncoded(), "AES");

/* Encrypt the message. */
Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding");
cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret);
AlgorithmParameters params = cipher.getParameters();
byte[] iv = params.getParameterSpec(IvParameterSpec.class).getIV();
byte[] cipherText = cipher.doFinal(toBeEncrypted.getBytes("UTF-8"));
encryptedData = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(cipherText);
encryptedData += Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(iv);
What I can not understand is how should I generate similar output (encryptedData) to what OpenSSL does. I have the salt, iv and cipherText, is the OpenSSL output Base64 encoded result of a concatenation of these? or only one single of them?

The only thing I share with that other system before encryption is the pass phrase. How could they decrypt the result if salt and number of iterations is not known to them?

Can somebody give answers to those unknown parameters and also tell me if the above code is the equivalent of OpenSSL process?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Refer to Official Documentation**: Identify the obsolete function and review the official documentation to understand why it is deprecated and what alternatives are recommended.  
2. **Replace with Modern Alternatives**: Substitute the obsolete function with its modern, secure counterpart, ensuring compatibility with the current version of the programming language.  
3. **Validate Security Implications**: Assess the security impact of the replacement function to ensure it adheres to best practices and does not introduce new vulnerabilities.  
4. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all libraries, frameworks, and tools are up-to-date to support the use of modern functions.  
5. **Conduct Code Reviews**: Perform thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate other instances of obsolete functions in the codebase.

#### **Output Format**  
The solution must be generated as a **single, complete, and executable code snippet** that replaces the obsolete function with its secure, modern alternative.

#### **Solution Language**
