Objective:
Generate a secure code snippet that addresses the provided problem statement, incorporating all relevant mitigation strategies to prevent or remediate the identified CWE vulnerabilities (CWE-259, CWE-295, CWE-327, CWE-397, CWE-477, CWE-798).

Problem Statement:
"Can someone help me to understand what Java CountDownLatch is and when to use it?

I don't have a very clear idea of how this program works. As I understand all three threads start at once and each Thread will call CountDownLatch after 3000ms. So count down will decrement one by one. After latch becomes zero the program prints "Completed". Maybe the way I understood is incorrect.

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Processor implements Runnable {
    private CountDownLatch latch;

    public Processor(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Started.");

        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        latch.countDown();
    }
}
// -----------------------------------------------------

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // coundown from 3 to 0

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // 3 Threads in pool

        for(int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Processor(latch)); // ref to latch. each time call new Processes latch will count down by 1
        }

        try {
            latch.await();  // wait until latch counted down to 0
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Completed.");
    }

}"

Mitigation Strategies:
Based on the provided CWE information, the following security best practices and guidelines will be applied:

* **CWE-259 & CWE-798 (Hard-coded Credentials):**
    * Avoid hard-coding passwords or credentials directly into the code.
    * Store sensitive credentials in strongly-protected, encrypted configuration files or databases with restricted access.
    * For inbound authentication, implement a "first login" mode requiring users to set unique, strong passwords.
    * Apply strong one-way hashing with random salts to stored passwords.
    * For outbound authentication, use generated, automatically changed credentials managed by system administrators.
    * Limit the permissions of stored credentials to the minimum necessary.
* **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation):**
    * Implement thorough certificate validation, ensuring certificates are properly managed and checked.
    * If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant certificate properties before pinning.
* **CWE-327 (Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm):**
    * Use strong, up-to-date, and well-vetted cryptographic algorithms.
    * Avoid developing custom cryptographic algorithms.
    * Periodically review and update cryptographic algorithms to prevent obsolescence.
    * Ensure the design allows for easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms.
    * Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys.
    * Use well tested cryptographic libraries.
    * Avoid skipping resource intensive cryptographic steps.
* **CWE-397 (Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception):**
    * Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception, Throwable).
    * Use specific exception types to facilitate proper error handling.
* **CWE-477 (Use of Obsolete Function):**
    * Avoid using obsolete functions.
    * Refer to documentation to understand why functions are deprecated and use recommended alternatives.
    * Consider the security implications of using obsolete functions.

Output Format:
