**Objective:**  Hard-coded passwords pose a severe security risk, enabling unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.  Exploitation can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and potentially widespread attacks if default credentials are shared across multiple deployments.  This template aims to generate solutions that eliminate hard-coded credentials and enforce secure authentication practices.

**Problem Statement:**  "Can someone help me to understand what Java CountDownLatch is and when to use it?

I don't have a very clear idea of how this program works. As I understand all three threads start at once and each Thread will call CountDownLatch after 3000ms. So count down will decrement one by one. After latch becomes zero the program prints "Completed". Maybe the way I understood is incorrect.

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Processor implements Runnable {
    private CountDownLatch latch;

    public Processor(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Started.");

        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        latch.countDown();
    }
}
// -----------------------------------------------------

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // coundown from 3 to 0

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // 3 Threads in pool

        for(int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Processor(latch)); // ref to latch. each time call new Processes latch will count down by 1
        }

        try {
            latch.await();  // wait until latch counted down to 0
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Completed.");
    }

}"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  The generated solution MUST adhere to the following principles:

* **No Hard-coded Credentials:**  Eliminate all hard-coded passwords from the codebase.
* **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys, etc.) outside of the code, preferably in a secure configuration file, environment variables, or a dedicated secrets management system.
* **Strong Encryption:** Encrypt stored credentials using strong encryption algorithms and protect the encryption key.
* **Least Privilege:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive credentials and resources.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input to prevent injection attacks.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
* **Outbound Authentication:** Use robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys) for communicating with external systems.
* **Inbound Authentication:** Implement secure password hashing with unique salts for storing and verifying user passwords.  Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.


**Output Format:**  A single, complete, and compilable/executable code snippet demonstrating the secure solution.
