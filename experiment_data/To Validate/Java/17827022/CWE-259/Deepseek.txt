#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded passwords poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and widespread exploitation. This issue is particularly dangerous because hard-coded credentials are often identical across installations, making them susceptible to large-scale attacks. The objective is to eliminate hard-coded passwords by implementing secure authentication mechanisms and storing credentials securely.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"Can someone help me to understand what Java CountDownLatch is and when to use it?

I don't have a very clear idea of how this program works. As I understand all three threads start at once and each Thread will call CountDownLatch after 3000ms. So count down will decrement one by one. After latch becomes zero the program prints "Completed". Maybe the way I understood is incorrect.

import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Processor implements Runnable {
    private CountDownLatch latch;

    public Processor(CountDownLatch latch) {
        this.latch = latch;
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Started.");

        try {
            Thread.sleep(3000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        latch.countDown();
    }
}
// -----------------------------------------------------

public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3); // coundown from 3 to 0

        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // 3 Threads in pool

        for(int i=0; i < 3; i++) {
            executor.submit(new Processor(latch)); // ref to latch. each time call new Processes latch will count down by 1
        }

        try {
            latch.await();  // wait until latch counted down to 0
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Completed.");
    }

}"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-coded Passwords**: Store passwords outside the code in a secure, encrypted configuration file or database.  
2. **Use Strong Password Policies**: For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique, strong password during initial setup.  
3. **Encrypt and Hash Passwords**: Apply strong one-way hashing with unique salts to stored passwords.  
4. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to sensitive features and ensure credentials are only accessible to authorized entities.  
5. **Dynamic Credentials**: For front-end to back-end connections, use dynamically generated, time-limited credentials with restricted permissions.
