#### **Problem Statement**  
"We have aes-256 encryption for some data in one of the tables and we are migrating this to sql server. The problem is that we cannot decrypt the data in sql server due to incompatibility. Is there any way we can encrypt data in MYSQL in a way which is compatible with sql server aswell. Any advise ?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Credentials**:  
   - Store credentials (e.g., passwords, keys) outside the code in a strongly protected, encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults for credential management.
   - Ensure proper access control and encryption for stored credentials.

2. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms**:  
   - Employ up-to-date, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256).
   - Avoid deprecated or broken algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1).
   - Use randomly generated salts for password hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.

3. **Implement Secure Authentication Mechanisms**:  
   - For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique strong password during first login.
   - For outbound authentication, use dynamically generated credentials with limited validity periods.
   - Validate certificates fully (e.g., hostname, expiration) when using certificate pinning.

4. **Prevent Generic Exception Handling**:  
   - Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception or Throwable).
   - Use specific exception types to enable proper error handling and recovery.

5. **Avoid Obsolete Functions**:  
   - Replace deprecated or obsolete functions with their modern, secure counterparts.
   - Refer to language documentation for recommended alternatives.
