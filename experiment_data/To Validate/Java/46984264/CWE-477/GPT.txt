## Objective
The use of obsolete functions in code can lead to security vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and maintenance challenges. These outdated functions may lack important security enhancements provided by newer alternatives and can pose risks such as unexpected behavior or compatibility issues. Addressing the use of obsolete functions is crucial for ensuring the security and robustness of software applications.

## Problem Statement
"We have aes-256 encryption for some data in one of the tables and we are migrating this to sql server. The problem is that we cannot decrypt the data in sql server due to incompatibility. Is there any way we can encrypt data in MYSQL in a way which is compatible with sql server aswell. Any advise ?"

## Mitigation Strategies
1. **Documentation Review**: Thoroughly examine the documentation related to the obsolete function to understand the reasons for its deprecation. Identify alternative functions or approaches recommended by the language maintainers or community.
2. **Consider Security Implications**: Assess the security outcomes of continuing to use the deprecated function. Prioritize finding and implementing a more secure and efficient alternative to eliminate potential risks and enhance application security.
3. **Adopt New Conventions**: Familiarize yourself with the best practices and modern conventions that have replaced the obsolete function to ensure the application complies with up-to-date security standards and operational efficiency.

## Output Format
The solution must be presented as a single, complete code snippet that effectively replaces the obsolete function while addressing the identified security concerns.

## Solution Language
