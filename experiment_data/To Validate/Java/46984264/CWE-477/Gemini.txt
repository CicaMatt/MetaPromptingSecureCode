**Objective:**  Using obsolete functions introduces security risks due to potential vulnerabilities in the outdated code, lack of support, and incompatibility with newer systems. This can lead to exploitable weaknesses, system instability, and difficulties in maintenance.  Modernizing code by replacing obsolete functions is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.

**Problem Statement:**  "We have aes-256 encryption for some data in one of the tables and we are migrating this to sql server. The problem is that we cannot decrypt the data in sql server due to incompatibility. Is there any way we can encrypt data in MYSQL in a way which is compatible with sql server aswell. Any advise ?"

**Mitigation Strategies:** To address the use of obsolete functions, follow these guidelines:

* **Identify Obsolete Functions:**  Consult the official documentation for your programming language and libraries to confirm the obsolescence of the suspected function.
* **Understand the Risks:** Research the specific vulnerabilities associated with the obsolete function. This might include buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or insecure data handling.
* **Recommended Alternatives:** Identify and implement the recommended replacement function or approach suggested by the language documentation or security best practices.  Prioritize functions designed with security in mind.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the updated code to ensure the replacement function works correctly and does not introduce new vulnerabilities.

**Output Format:** The solution MUST be provided as a single, complete, and ready-to-use code snippet.

**Solution Language:**  Java
