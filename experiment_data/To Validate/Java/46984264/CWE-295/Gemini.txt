**Objective:** Improper certificate validation exposes systems to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to impersonate trusted entities, intercept sensitive data, and potentially inject malicious code. This can compromise data confidentiality and integrity, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and reputational damage.

**Problem Statement:**  "We have aes-256 encryption for some data in one of the tables and we are migrating this to sql server. The problem is that we cannot decrypt the data in sql server due to incompatibility. Is there any way we can encrypt data in MYSQL in a way which is compatible with sql server aswell. Any advise ?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Validate all relevant certificate properties:** Ensure that the certificate chain, hostname, expiration date, and issuer are thoroughly validated before accepting the certificate.
* **Avoid disabling certificate validation:**  Disabling certificate validation completely eliminates security benefits and should never be done in production environments.
* **Implement certificate pinning cautiously:** If certificate pinning is used, rigorously validate all certificate details before pinning to prevent future validation issues.  Ensure the pinned certificate is updated appropriately when it expires.
* **Use trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs):**  Whenever possible, use certificates issued by reputable and trusted CAs.
* **Keep certificate stores updated:** Regularly update certificate stores to include the latest root and intermediate certificates.


**Output Format:**  The solution must be a single, complete, and runnable code snippet that directly addresses the described problem.

**Solution Language:** Java
