**Objective:**  This vulnerability involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception (e.g., `Exception`, `Throwable` in Java) instead of specific exceptions. This practice hinders effective error handling and recovery by callers, masking the true nature of potential errors and making it difficult to implement precise exception handling logic. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, difficulties in debugging, and potentially security vulnerabilities if errors are not handled appropriately.

**Problem Statement:**  "I am using Java 6 and am trying to create an HttpsURLConnection against a remote server, using a client certificate.
The server is using an selfsigned root certificate, and requires that a password-protected client certificate is presented. I've added the server root certificate and the client certificate to a default java keystore which I found in /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6.0/Home/lib/security/cacerts (OSX 10.5). The name of the keystore file seems to suggest that the client certificate is not supposed to go in there?

Anyway, adding the root certificate to this store solved the infamous javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path building failed' problem.

However, I'm now stuck on how to use the client certificate. I've tried two approaches and neither gets me anywhere.
First, and preferred, try:

SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
URL url = new URL("https://somehost.dk:3049");
HttpsURLConnection conn = (HttpsURLConnection)url.openConnection();
conn.setSSLSocketFactory(sslsocketfactory);
InputStream inputstream = conn.getInputStream();
// The last line fails, and gives:
// javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure
I've tried skipping the HttpsURLConnection class (not ideal since I want to talk HTTP with the server), and do this instead:

SSLSocketFactory sslsocketfactory = (SSLSocketFactory) SSLSocketFactory.getDefault();
SSLSocket sslsocket = (SSLSocket) sslsocketfactory.createSocket("somehost.dk", 3049);
InputStream inputstream = sslsocket.getInputStream();
// do anything with the inputstream results in:
// java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out
I am not even sure that the client certificate is the problem here."

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Identify Specific Exceptions:** Analyze the code within the method to determine the specific types of exceptions that could be thrown.  
* **Replace Generic Exception:** Replace the generic `Exception` or `Throwable` declaration in the method signature with the identified specific exception types.  If multiple exceptions are possible, list them individually separated by commas (e.g., `IOException, IllegalArgumentException`).
* **Implement Targeted Exception Handling:** In the calling code, implement `try-catch` blocks to handle each specific exception appropriately. This allows for tailored error recovery logic based on the specific nature of the error.
* **Avoid Empty Catch Blocks:** Never leave a `catch` block empty.  At a minimum, log the exception to aid in debugging.  Implement proper error handling or rethrow the exception if it cannot be handled locally.
* **Consider Custom Exceptions:** For specific error conditions unique to your application, define custom exception classes that inherit from relevant built-in exception types.


**Output Format:**  Provide a single, complete, and compilable code snippet that demonstrates the corrected method declaration and associated exception handling in the calling code.
