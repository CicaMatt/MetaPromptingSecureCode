#### **Objective**  
Improper certificate validation can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker spoofs a trusted entity, intercepts sensitive data, or deceives the system into accepting malicious data. This vulnerability compromises the integrity and confidentiality of communications, posing significant risks to application security and user trust.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I am getting the below exception while connecting to my mailserver while executing the below line

transport.connect("test.mailserver.com",465,"test.user@test.com","testpwd");
The Exception is:

(javax.mail.MessagingException) javax.mail.MessagingException: Exception reading response;
nested exception is:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: subject/issuer name chaining check failed
below is the code:

protected static Session initializeSession(MailMessage p_msg) throws Exception{

    //Get the SMTP Host
    Properties prop = System.getProperties();
    prop.put( "mail.smtps.host", "test.mailserver.com" );
    prop.put("mail.transport.protocol", "smtps");
    prop.put("mail.smtps.auth", true);

    Session session = Session.getInstance(prop,null);
    session.setDebug( p_msg.getDebugMode() );
    return session;
}   
protected static void sendMessage(MimeMessage p_msg)  throws Exception{

    Properties prop = System.getProperties();

    Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(prop, null);
    Transport transport = session.getTransport("smtps");
        transport.connect("test.mailserver.com",465,"test.user@test.com","testpwd");
    transport.sendMessage(p_msg, p_msg.getAllRecipients());
    transport.close();
}"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Certificate Management**:  
   - Ensure certificates are carefully managed and validated to confirm they are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  
   - Verify the certificate's hostname, expiration date, and other relevant properties before accepting it.  

2. **Certificate Pinning**:  
   - If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant properties of the certificate (e.g., hostname, public key, and issuer) before pinning.  
   - Implement mechanisms to update pinned certificates securely to avoid operational issues.  

3. **Secure Communication Protocols**:  
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and enforce strict validation rules to prevent downgrade attacks.  

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - Implement robust error handling to reject invalid or untrusted certificates and log such events for monitoring and auditing.
