#### Objective
Address the security risk posed by the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms, known as CWE-327. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data unexpectedly, or spoof identities. This issue is especially challenging in hardware deployment due to difficulty in updating flawed algorithms.

#### Problem Statement
"I am getting the below exception while connecting to my mailserver while executing the below line

transport.connect("test.mailserver.com",465,"test.user@test.com","testpwd");
The Exception is:

(javax.mail.MessagingException) javax.mail.MessagingException: Exception reading response;
nested exception is:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: subject/issuer name chaining check failed
below is the code:

protected static Session initializeSession(MailMessage p_msg) throws Exception{

    //Get the SMTP Host
    Properties prop = System.getProperties();
    prop.put( "mail.smtps.host", "test.mailserver.com" );
    prop.put("mail.transport.protocol", "smtps");
    prop.put("mail.smtps.auth", true);

    Session session = Session.getInstance(prop,null);
    session.setDebug( p_msg.getDebugMode() );
    return session;
}   
protected static void sendMessage(MimeMessage p_msg)  throws Exception{

    Properties prop = System.getProperties();

    Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(prop, null);
    Transport transport = session.getTransport("smtps");
        transport.connect("test.mailserver.com",465,"test.user@test.com","testpwd");
    transport.sendMessage(p_msg, p_msg.getAllRecipients());
    transport.close();
}"

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Adopt Strong Algorithms:**
   - Use current, strong cryptographic algorithms vetted by experts, like AES or RSA, and adhere to standards such as FIPS 140-2.
   - Avoid custom or private algorithms to prevent easy exploitation by attackers.

2. **Periodic Review and Flexibility:**
   - Periodically review cryptographic implementations to ensure they remain secure.
   - Design systems to allow easy replacement of outdated algorithms, using uniform interfaces and wrappers where possible.

3. **Key Management:**
   - Protect cryptographic keys to ensure the overall strength of the cryptography.

4. **Use Reliable Libraries:**
   - Implement cryptographic operations using vetted libraries or frameworks, such as ESAPI, to reduce the risk of errors.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Follow industry-standard practices meticulously, ensuring all recommended steps are implemented without compromise.
