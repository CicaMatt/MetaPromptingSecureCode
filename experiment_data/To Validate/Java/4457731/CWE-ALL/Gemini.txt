Objective:
Generate a secure code snippet that addresses the provided problem statement, incorporating all relevant mitigation strategies to prevent or remediate the identified CWE vulnerabilities (CWE-259, CWE-295, CWE-327, CWE-397, CWE-477, CWE-798).

Problem Statement:
"I am getting the below exception while connecting to my mailserver while executing the below line

transport.connect("test.mailserver.com",465,"test.user@test.com","testpwd");
The Exception is:

(javax.mail.MessagingException) javax.mail.MessagingException: Exception reading response;
nested exception is:
javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: sun.security.validator.ValidatorException: PKIX path validation failed: java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: subject/issuer name chaining check failed
below is the code:

protected static Session initializeSession(MailMessage p_msg) throws Exception{

    //Get the SMTP Host
    Properties prop = System.getProperties();
    prop.put( "mail.smtps.host", "test.mailserver.com" );
    prop.put("mail.transport.protocol", "smtps");
    prop.put("mail.smtps.auth", true);

    Session session = Session.getInstance(prop,null);
    session.setDebug( p_msg.getDebugMode() );
    return session;
}   
protected static void sendMessage(MimeMessage p_msg)  throws Exception{

    Properties prop = System.getProperties();

    Session session = Session.getDefaultInstance(prop, null);
    Transport transport = session.getTransport("smtps");
        transport.connect("test.mailserver.com",465,"test.user@test.com","testpwd");
    transport.sendMessage(p_msg, p_msg.getAllRecipients());
    transport.close();
}"

Mitigation Strategies:
Based on the provided CWE information, the following security best practices and guidelines will be applied:

* **CWE-259 & CWE-798 (Hard-coded Credentials):**
    * Avoid hard-coding passwords or credentials directly into the code.
    * Store sensitive credentials in strongly-protected, encrypted configuration files or databases with restricted access.
    * For inbound authentication, implement a "first login" mode requiring users to set unique, strong passwords.
    * Apply strong one-way hashing with random salts to stored passwords.
    * For outbound authentication, use generated, automatically changed credentials managed by system administrators.
    * Limit the permissions of stored credentials to the minimum necessary.
* **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation):**
    * Implement thorough certificate validation, ensuring certificates are properly managed and checked.
    * If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant certificate properties before pinning.
* **CWE-327 (Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm):**
    * Use strong, up-to-date, and well-vetted cryptographic algorithms.
    * Avoid developing custom cryptographic algorithms.
    * Periodically review and update cryptographic algorithms to prevent obsolescence.
    * Ensure the design allows for easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms.
    * Carefully manage and protect cryptographic keys.
    * Use well tested cryptographic libraries.
    * Avoid skipping resource intensive cryptographic steps.
* **CWE-397 (Declaration of Throws for Generic Exception):**
    * Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception, Throwable).
    * Use specific exception types to facilitate proper error handling.
* **CWE-477 (Use of Obsolete Function):**
    * Avoid using obsolete functions.
    * Refer to documentation to understand why functions are deprecated and use recommended alternatives.
    * Consider the security implications of using obsolete functions.

Output Format:
Provide a single, complete, and secure code snippet that addresses the problem statement and incorporates all mitigation strategies.
