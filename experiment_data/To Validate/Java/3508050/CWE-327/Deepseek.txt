#### **Objective**  
The use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and identity spoofing. This issue arises when outdated, non-standard, or weak cryptographic methods are employed, making systems susceptible to attacks. The objective is to ensure the implementation of secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I would like to be able to get access to all trusted root certificates programmatically in a Java app.

I was looking at the keystore interface, but I'm hoping to get the list of trusted roots that's implicit with the JRE.

Is this accessible anywhere?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Use Strong, Up-to-Date Algorithms**: Replace outdated or weak algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, DES) with modern, vetted cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256, SHA-256, or SHA-3.  
2. **Leverage Vetted Libraries**: Utilize well-tested cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BouncyCastle, or language-specific libraries) to avoid implementation errors.  
3. **Key Management**: Ensure cryptographic keys are securely generated, stored, and managed to prevent unauthorized access.  
4. **Algorithm Agility**: Design systems to allow easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms as stronger alternatives become available.  
5. **Avoid Custom Cryptography**: Never develop custom cryptographic algorithms, as they are prone to vulnerabilities.  
6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with current security standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
