#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded passwords poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and widespread exploitation. This issue is particularly dangerous because hard-coded credentials are often identical across installations, making them susceptible to large-scale attacks. The objective is to eliminate hard-coded passwords by implementing secure authentication mechanisms and storing credentials securely.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I was passing sensitive information (between my app and backend) like password in String format. Later on I realized that password can be easily read from heap memory dump as it is stored in text format.

String password = "super_password";
So I decided to use Char array,

Char[] passChar = password.toCharArray();
but I am worried that password can still be read from memory dump character by character. Then I thought of using byte array instead.

byte[] passByte = password.getBytes();
My question: Is it safe to use byte array for passing sensitive information like password ? OR can anyone recommend anything secure ?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-coded Passwords**: Store passwords outside the code in a secure, encrypted configuration file or database.  
2. **Use Strong Password Policies**: For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique, strong password during initial setup.  
3. **Encrypt and Hash Passwords**: Apply strong one-way hashing with unique salts to stored passwords.  
4. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to sensitive features and ensure credentials are only accessible to authorized entities.  
5. **Dynamic Credentials**: For front-end to back-end connections, use dynamically generated, time-limited credentials with restricted permissions.
