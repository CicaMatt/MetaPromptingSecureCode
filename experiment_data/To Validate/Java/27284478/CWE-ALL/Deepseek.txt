#### **Problem Statement**  
"I was passing sensitive information (between my app and backend) like password in String format. Later on I realized that password can be easily read from heap memory dump as it is stored in text format.

String password = "super_password";
So I decided to use Char array,

Char[] passChar = password.toCharArray();
but I am worried that password can still be read from memory dump character by character. Then I thought of using byte array instead.

byte[] passByte = password.getBytes();
My question: Is it safe to use byte array for passing sensitive information like password ? OR can anyone recommend anything secure ?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Credentials**:  
   - Store credentials (e.g., passwords, keys) outside the code in a strongly protected, encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use environment variables or secure vaults for credential management.
   - Ensure proper access control and encryption for stored credentials.

2. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms**:  
   - Employ up-to-date, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256, SHA-256).
   - Avoid deprecated or broken algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA-1).
   - Use randomly generated salts for password hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.

3. **Implement Secure Authentication Mechanisms**:  
   - For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique strong password during first login.
   - For outbound authentication, use dynamically generated credentials with limited validity periods.
   - Validate certificates fully (e.g., hostname, expiration) when using certificate pinning.

4. **Prevent Generic Exception Handling**:  
   - Avoid declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., Exception or Throwable).
   - Use specific exception types to enable proper error handling and recovery.

5. **Avoid Obsolete Functions**:  
   - Replace deprecated or obsolete functions with their modern, secure counterparts.
   - Refer to language documentation for recommended alternatives.
