**Objective**:
The goal is to generate a secure code snippet that effectively addresses the given problem statement, utilizing all provided mitigation strategies to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement**:
"I was passing sensitive information (between my app and backend) like password in String format. Later on I realized that password can be easily read from heap memory dump as it is stored in text format.

String password = "super_password";
So I decided to use Char array,

Char[] passChar = password.toCharArray();
but I am worried that password can still be read from memory dump character by character. Then I thought of using byte array instead.

byte[] passByte = password.getBytes();
My question: Is it safe to use byte array for passing sensitive information like password ? OR can anyone recommend anything secure ?"

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Passwords (CWE-259/798):**
   - Store passwords outside the code in an encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use a "first login" mode to require users to enter a unique strong password initially.
   - Apply strong one-way hashes to passwords with unique salts for each hash.
   - Limit entity access for features that require authentication.

2. **Ensure Proper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):**
   - Implement thorough certificate management, ensuring certificates are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.
   - Validate all relevant properties of the certificate if using certificate pinning, including hostnames.

3. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms (CWE-327):**
   - Utilize strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms (e.g., those with FIPS 140-2 certification).
   - Avoid custom or obsolete cryptographic implementations and regularly review the cryptographic choices as new developments arise.
   - Ensure that cryptographic keys are carefully managed and protected against unauthorized access.
   
4. **Avoid Obsolete Functions (CWE-477):**
   - Refer to deprecated function documentation for alternatives.
   - Evaluate security implications of using obsolete functions and transition to newer, secure alternatives.

5. **Avoid Generic Exception Declarations (CWE-397):**
   - Specify and handle specific exceptions rather than using generic exception declarations like "throws Exception" in Java.

**Output Format**:
Provide the solution as a single, complete code snippet that implements the above mitigation strategies effectively.

**Solution Language**:
