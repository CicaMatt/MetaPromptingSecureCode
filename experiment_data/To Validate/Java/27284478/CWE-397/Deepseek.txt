#### **Objective**  
The security concern revolves around declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., `Exception` or `Throwable`), which undermines proper error handling and recovery. This practice makes it difficult for callers to anticipate specific exceptional circumstances, leading to inadequate error management, potential security vulnerabilities, and reduced code maintainability. The impact includes increased risk of unhandled exceptions, poor debugging, and potential exploitation of unanticipated error states.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I was passing sensitive information (between my app and backend) like password in String format. Later on I realized that password can be easily read from heap memory dump as it is stored in text format.

String password = "super_password";
So I decided to use Char array,

Char[] passChar = password.toCharArray();
but I am worried that password can still be read from memory dump character by character. Then I thought of using byte array instead.

byte[] passByte = password.getBytes();
My question: Is it safe to use byte array for passing sensitive information like password ? OR can anyone recommend anything secure ?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: Declare specific exceptions that a method can throw, enabling callers to handle each exception appropriately.  
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios to improve clarity and maintainability.  
3. **Exception Hierarchy**: Use existing exception classes in the language (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`) to provide meaningful context.  
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions a method can throw to guide callers in implementing proper error handling.  
5. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure compliance with exception-handling best practices.
