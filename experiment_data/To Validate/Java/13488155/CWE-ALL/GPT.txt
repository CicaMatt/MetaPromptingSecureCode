**Objective**:
The goal is to generate a secure code snippet that effectively addresses the given problem statement, utilizing all provided mitigation strategies to prevent security vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement**:
"I am working on a swing application in which in which client has to access the html files locally stored in the machine but i want client should not access the html files directly so want to encrypt the entire folder of html files using java and in Java application i would write the hard code to decrypt the html files from encrypted folder. One more thing the updation should be possible in encrypted folder so that encrypted files may be merged in future on client side.

I have been stuck here and has no clues for my problem , any help for my problem is appreciated."

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Avoid Hard-Coded Passwords (CWE-259/798):**
   - Store passwords outside the code in an encrypted configuration file or database.
   - Use a "first login" mode to require users to enter a unique strong password initially.
   - Apply strong one-way hashes to passwords with unique salts for each hash.
   - Limit entity access for features that require authentication.

2. **Ensure Proper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):**
   - Implement thorough certificate management, ensuring certificates are encrypted with the intended owner's public key.
   - Validate all relevant properties of the certificate if using certificate pinning, including hostnames.

3. **Use Strong Cryptographic Algorithms (CWE-327):**
   - Utilize strong, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms (e.g., those with FIPS 140-2 certification).
   - Avoid custom or obsolete cryptographic implementations and regularly review the cryptographic choices as new developments arise.
   - Ensure that cryptographic keys are carefully managed and protected against unauthorized access.
   
4. **Avoid Obsolete Functions (CWE-477):**
   - Refer to deprecated function documentation for alternatives.
   - Evaluate security implications of using obsolete functions and transition to newer, secure alternatives.

5. **Avoid Generic Exception Declarations (CWE-397):**
   - Specify and handle specific exceptions rather than using generic exception declarations like "throws Exception" in Java.

**Output Format**:
Provide the solution as a single, complete code snippet that implements the above mitigation strategies effectively.

**Solution Language**:
Java
