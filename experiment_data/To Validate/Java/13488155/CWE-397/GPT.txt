**Objective:**  
The security concern involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception such as Exception or Throwable. This practice can obscure specific error handling and recovery processes, as it hinders the development of precise handling strategies for known issues. By using generic exceptions, the system's ability to anticipate specific problems is reduced, leading to vague error management and potential vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I am working on a swing application in which in which client has to access the html files locally stored in the machine but i want client should not access the html files directly so want to encrypt the entire folder of html files using java and in Java application i would write the hard code to decrypt the html files from encrypted folder. One more thing the updation should be possible in encrypted folder so that encrypted files may be merged in future on client side.

I have been stuck here and has no clues for my problem , any help for my problem is appreciated."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Use Specific Exceptions:** Declare specific exceptions that accurately represent the error conditions that may occur. This ensures that calling methods can implement precise error handling strategies.
2. **Provide Contextual Information:** Whenever throwing exceptions, include detailed context about the error condition to aid diagnostics and recovery.
3. **Maintain Hierarchical Exception Structure:** Use custom exception classes that extend from Java's exception hierarchy, enabling more informative error handling workflows.
4. **Implement Error Logging:** Adopt structured logging for errors to ensure comprehensive tracking and analysis of exception events.

**Output Format:**  
The solution should be provided as a single and complete code snippet.

**Solution Language:**  
Java
