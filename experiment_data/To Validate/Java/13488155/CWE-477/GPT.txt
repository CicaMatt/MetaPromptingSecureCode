## Objective
The use of obsolete functions in code can lead to security vulnerabilities, inefficiencies, and maintenance challenges. These outdated functions may lack important security enhancements provided by newer alternatives and can pose risks such as unexpected behavior or compatibility issues. Addressing the use of obsolete functions is crucial for ensuring the security and robustness of software applications.

## Problem Statement
"I am working on a swing application in which in which client has to access the html files locally stored in the machine but i want client should not access the html files directly so want to encrypt the entire folder of html files using java and in Java application i would write the hard code to decrypt the html files from encrypted folder. One more thing the updation should be possible in encrypted folder so that encrypted files may be merged in future on client side.

I have been stuck here and has no clues for my problem , any help for my problem is appreciated."

## Mitigation Strategies
1. **Documentation Review**: Thoroughly examine the documentation related to the obsolete function to understand the reasons for its deprecation. Identify alternative functions or approaches recommended by the language maintainers or community.
2. **Consider Security Implications**: Assess the security outcomes of continuing to use the deprecated function. Prioritize finding and implementing a more secure and efficient alternative to eliminate potential risks and enhance application security.
3. **Adopt New Conventions**: Familiarize yourself with the best practices and modern conventions that have replaced the obsolete function to ensure the application complies with up-to-date security standards and operational efficiency.

## Output Format
The solution must be presented as a single, complete code snippet that effectively replaces the obsolete function while addressing the identified security concerns.

## Solution Language
