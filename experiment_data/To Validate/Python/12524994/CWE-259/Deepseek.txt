#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded passwords poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and widespread exploitation. This issue is particularly dangerous because hard-coded credentials are often identical across installations, making them susceptible to large-scale attacks. The objective is to eliminate hard-coded passwords by implementing secure authentication mechanisms and storing credentials securely.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.

I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:

This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.

Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen?

Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/

Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-coded Passwords**: Store passwords outside the code in a secure, encrypted configuration file or database.  
2. **Use Strong Password Policies**: For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique, strong password during initial setup.  
3. **Encrypt and Hash Passwords**: Apply strong one-way hashing with unique salts to stored passwords.  
4. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to sensitive features and ensure credentials are only accessible to authorized entities.  
5. **Dynamic Credentials**: For front-end to back-end connections, use dynamically generated, time-limited credentials with restricted permissions.
