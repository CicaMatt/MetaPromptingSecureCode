**Objective:**  
The primary security concern is the use of hard-coded passwords in a software product, which can lead to significant authentication failures. These weaknesses can result in unauthorized access, exploitation, and potential system compromise, affecting system integrity and security. Hard-coded passwords are difficult to detect, challenging to fix, and can potentially force disabling of the product if publicized.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.

I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:

This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.

Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen?

Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/

Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architecture and Design Phase:**
   - **Outbound Authentication:**
     - Store passwords in a securely encrypted configuration file or database, ensuring protection from unauthorized access.
     - Protect the encryption key with appropriate security measures (CWE-320).
   - **Inbound Authentication:**
     - Implement a "first login" mode to prompt users to create a unique, strong password.
     - Apply strong one-way hashing to passwords, storing hashes with proper access control. Use per-user salting to enhance security against brute-force attacks.
   - **Access Control:**
     - Enforce strict access control checks, limiting feature access that requires authenticating with hard-coded passwords.
   - **Front-end to Back-end Connections:**
     - Utilize generated passwords that change automatically and require periodic manual entry by a system administrator.
     - Limit front-end granted actions on the back-end system.
     - Implement message tagging and checksumming to prevent replay attacks.

**Output Format:**  
The solution must be generated as a single and complete code snippet.

**Solution Language:**
