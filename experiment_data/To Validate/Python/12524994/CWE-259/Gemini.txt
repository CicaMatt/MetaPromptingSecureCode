**Objective:**  Hard-coded passwords pose a severe security risk, enabling unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.  Exploitation can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and potentially widespread attacks if default credentials are shared across multiple deployments.  This template aims to generate solutions that eliminate hard-coded credentials and enforce secure authentication practices.

**Problem Statement:**  "I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.

I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:

This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.

Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen?

Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/

Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  The generated solution MUST adhere to the following principles:

* **No Hard-coded Credentials:**  Eliminate all hard-coded passwords from the codebase.
* **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys, etc.) outside of the code, preferably in a secure configuration file, environment variables, or a dedicated secrets management system.
* **Strong Encryption:** Encrypt stored credentials using strong encryption algorithms and protect the encryption key.
* **Least Privilege:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive credentials and resources.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input to prevent injection attacks.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
* **Outbound Authentication:** Use robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys) for communicating with external systems.
* **Inbound Authentication:** Implement secure password hashing with unique salts for storing and verifying user passwords.  Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.


**Output Format:**  A single, complete, and compilable/executable code snippet demonstrating the secure solution.

**Solution Language:**  Python
