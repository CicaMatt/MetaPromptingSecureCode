**Objective:**  
The security concern involves declaring a method to throw a generic exception such as Exception or Throwable. This practice can obscure specific error handling and recovery processes, as it hinders the development of precise handling strategies for known issues. By using generic exceptions, the system's ability to anticipate specific problems is reduced, leading to vague error management and potential vulnerabilities.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.

I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:

This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.

Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen?

Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/

Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Use Specific Exceptions:** Declare specific exceptions that accurately represent the error conditions that may occur. This ensures that calling methods can implement precise error handling strategies.
2. **Provide Contextual Information:** Whenever throwing exceptions, include detailed context about the error condition to aid diagnostics and recovery.
3. **Maintain Hierarchical Exception Structure:** Use custom exception classes that extend from Java's exception hierarchy, enabling more informative error handling workflows.
4. **Implement Error Logging:** Adopt structured logging for errors to ensure comprehensive tracking and analysis of exception events.

**Output Format:**  
The solution should be provided as a single and complete code snippet.

**Solution Language:**
