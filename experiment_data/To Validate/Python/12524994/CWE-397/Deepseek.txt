#### **Objective**  
The security concern revolves around declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., `Exception` or `Throwable`), which undermines proper error handling and recovery. This practice makes it difficult for callers to anticipate specific exceptional circumstances, leading to inadequate error management, potential security vulnerabilities, and reduced code maintainability. The impact includes increased risk of unhandled exceptions, poor debugging, and potential exploitation of unanticipated error states.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.

I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:

This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.

Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen?

Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/

Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: Declare specific exceptions that a method can throw, enabling callers to handle each exception appropriately.  
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios to improve clarity and maintainability.  
3. **Exception Hierarchy**: Use existing exception classes in the language (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`) to provide meaningful context.  
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions a method can throw to guide callers in implementing proper error handling.  
5. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure compliance with exception-handling best practices.
