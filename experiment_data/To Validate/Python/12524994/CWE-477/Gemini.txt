**Objective:**  Using obsolete functions introduces security risks due to potential vulnerabilities in the outdated code, lack of support, and incompatibility with newer systems. This can lead to exploitable weaknesses, system instability, and difficulties in maintenance.  Modernizing code by replacing obsolete functions is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.

**Problem Statement:**  "I'm trying to build two functions using PyCrypto that accept two parameters: the message and the key, and then encrypt/decrypt the message.

I found several links on the web to help me out, but each one of them has flaws:

This one at codekoala uses os.urandom, which is discouraged by PyCrypto.

Moreover, the key I give to the function is not guaranteed to have the exact length expected. What can I do to make that happen?

Also, there are several modes, which one is recommended? I don't know what to use :/

Finally, what exactly is the IV? Can I provide a different IV for encrypting and decrypting, or will this return in a different result?"

**Mitigation Strategies:** To address the use of obsolete functions, follow these guidelines:

* **Identify Obsolete Functions:**  Consult the official documentation for your programming language and libraries to confirm the obsolescence of the suspected function.
* **Understand the Risks:** Research the specific vulnerabilities associated with the obsolete function. This might include buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or insecure data handling.
* **Recommended Alternatives:** Identify and implement the recommended replacement function or approach suggested by the language documentation or security best practices.  Prioritize functions designed with security in mind.
* **Testing:** Thoroughly test the updated code to ensure the replacement function works correctly and does not introduce new vulnerabilities.

**Output Format:** The solution MUST be provided as a single, complete, and ready-to-use code snippet.

**Solution Language:**  Python
