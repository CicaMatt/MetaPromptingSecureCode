#### **Objective**  
Improper certificate validation can lead to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker spoofs a trusted entity, intercepts sensitive data, or deceives the system into accepting malicious data. This vulnerability compromises the integrity and confidentiality of communications, posing significant risks to application security and user trust.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I already have a working program, but the only thing that doesn't work is the decrypt_file() function I have. I can still copy the encrypted text from the file and put it in my decrypt() function and have it work, but when I try to use my supposed-to-be handy decrypt_file() function it throws an error. Now I know 99.999% sure that my encrypt() and decrypt() functions are fine, but there is something with the bytes and strings conversion when I read and encode the text file that throws an error; I just can't find the hangup. Please help!

My Program:

from Crypto import Random
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

def encrypt(message, key=None, key_size=256):
    def pad(s):
        x = AES.block_size - len(s) % AES.block_size
        return s + ((bytes([x])) * x)

    padded_message = pad(message)

    if key is None:
        key = Random.new().read(key_size // 8)

    iv = Random.new().read(AES.block_size)
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)

    return iv + cipher.encrypt(padded_message)

def decrypt(ciphertext, key):
    unpad = lambda s: s[:-s[-1]]
    iv = ciphertext[:AES.block_size]
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    plaintext = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ciphertext))[AES.block_size:]

    return plaintext

def encrypt_file(file_name, key):
    f = open(file_name, 'r')
    plaintext = f.read()
    plaintext = plaintext.encode('utf-8')
    enc = encrypt(plaintext, key)
    f.close()
    f = open(file_name, 'w')
    f.write(str(enc))
    f.close()

def decrypt_file(file_name, key):
    def pad(s):
        x = AES.block_size - len(s) % AES.block_size
        return s + ((str(bytes([x]))) * x)

    f = open(file_name, 'r')
    plaintext = f.read()
    x = AES.block_size - len(plaintext) % AES.block_size
    plaintext += ((bytes([x]))) * x
    dec = decrypt(plaintext, key)
    f.close()
    f = open(file_name, 'w')
    f.write(str(dec))
    f.close()



key = b'\xbf\xc0\x85)\x10nc\x94\x02)j\xdf\xcb\xc4\x94\x9d(\x9e[EX\xc8\xd5\xbfI{\xa2$\x05(\xd5\x18'

encrypt_file('to_enc.txt', key)
The text file I encrypted:

b';c\xb0\xe6Wv5!\xa3\xdd\xf0\xb1\xfd2\x90B\x10\xdf\x00\x82\x83\x9d\xbc2\x91\xa7i M\x13\xdc\xa7'
My error when attempting decrypt_file:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python33\testing\test\crypto.py", line 56, in <module>
    decrypt_file('to_enc.txt', key)
  File "C:\Python33\testing\test\crypto.py", line 45, in decrypt_file
    plaintext += ((bytes([x]))) * x
TypeError: Can't convert 'bytes' object to str implicitly
[Finished in 1.5s]
When I replace line 45 with: plaintext += ((str(bytes([x])))) * x, this is the error I get:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\Python33\testing\test\crypto.py", line 56, in <module>

    plaintext = unpad(cipher.decrypt(ciphertext))[AES.block_size:]

    return self._cipher.decrypt(ciphertext)

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Certificate Management**:  
   - Ensure certificates are carefully managed and validated to confirm they are issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).  
   - Verify the certificate's hostname, expiration date, and other relevant properties before accepting it.  

2. **Certificate Pinning**:  
   - If using certificate pinning, validate all relevant properties of the certificate (e.g., hostname, public key, and issuer) before pinning.  
   - Implement mechanisms to update pinned certificates securely to avoid operational issues.  

3. **Secure Communication Protocols**:  
   - Use secure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2 or higher) and enforce strict validation rules to prevent downgrade attacks.  

4. **Error Handling**:  
   - Implement robust error handling to reject invalid or untrusted certificates and log such events for monitoring and auditing.
