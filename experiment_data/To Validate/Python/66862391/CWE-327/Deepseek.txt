#### **Objective**  
The use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and identity spoofing. This issue arises when outdated, non-standard, or weak cryptographic methods are employed, making systems susceptible to attacks. The objective is to ensure the implementation of secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I am trying to get rid of the openssl call below and replace it with pure python code.

import os
    
iv = "7bde5a0f3f39fd658efc45de143cbc94"
password = "3e83b13d99bf0de6c6bde5ac5ca4ae68"
msg = "this is a message"

out = os.popen(f'printf "{msg}" | openssl aes-128-cbc -base64 -K {password} -iv {iv}').read()

print(f"IV: {iv}")    
print(f"PWD: {password}")     
print(f"MSG: {msg}")   
print(f"OUT: {out}")   
yields:

IV: 7bde5a0f3f39fd658efc45de143cbc94
PWD: 3e83b13d99bf0de6c6bde5ac5ca4ae68
MSG: this is a message
OUT: ukMTwxkz19qVPiwU8xa/YM9ENqklbZtB86AaVPULHLE=
Between the 3 different libraries that people seem to suggest and various other code excerpts that don't seem to work anymore, I haven't been able to replicate it in pure python reliably. Would anyone have a working code example for the above?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Use Strong, Up-to-Date Algorithms**: Replace outdated or weak algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, DES) with modern, vetted cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256, SHA-256, or SHA-3.  
2. **Leverage Vetted Libraries**: Utilize well-tested cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BouncyCastle, or language-specific libraries) to avoid implementation errors.  
3. **Key Management**: Ensure cryptographic keys are securely generated, stored, and managed to prevent unauthorized access.  
4. **Algorithm Agility**: Design systems to allow easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms as stronger alternatives become available.  
5. **Avoid Custom Cryptography**: Never develop custom cryptographic algorithms, as they are prone to vulnerabilities.  
6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with current security standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
