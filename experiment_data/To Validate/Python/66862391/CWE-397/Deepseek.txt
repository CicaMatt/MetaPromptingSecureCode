#### **Objective**  
The security concern revolves around declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., `Exception` or `Throwable`), which undermines proper error handling and recovery. This practice makes it difficult for callers to anticipate specific exceptional circumstances, leading to inadequate error management, potential security vulnerabilities, and reduced code maintainability. The impact includes increased risk of unhandled exceptions, poor debugging, and potential exploitation of unanticipated error states.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I am trying to get rid of the openssl call below and replace it with pure python code.

import os
    
iv = "7bde5a0f3f39fd658efc45de143cbc94"
password = "3e83b13d99bf0de6c6bde5ac5ca4ae68"
msg = "this is a message"

out = os.popen(f'printf "{msg}" | openssl aes-128-cbc -base64 -K {password} -iv {iv}').read()

print(f"IV: {iv}")    
print(f"PWD: {password}")     
print(f"MSG: {msg}")   
print(f"OUT: {out}")   
yields:

IV: 7bde5a0f3f39fd658efc45de143cbc94
PWD: 3e83b13d99bf0de6c6bde5ac5ca4ae68
MSG: this is a message
OUT: ukMTwxkz19qVPiwU8xa/YM9ENqklbZtB86AaVPULHLE=
Between the 3 different libraries that people seem to suggest and various other code excerpts that don't seem to work anymore, I haven't been able to replicate it in pure python reliably. Would anyone have a working code example for the above?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: Declare specific exceptions that a method can throw, enabling callers to handle each exception appropriately.  
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios to improve clarity and maintainability.  
3. **Exception Hierarchy**: Use existing exception classes in the language (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`) to provide meaningful context.  
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions a method can throw to guide callers in implementing proper error handling.  
5. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure compliance with exception-handling best practices.
