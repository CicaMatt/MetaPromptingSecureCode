**Objective:**  The use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm can severely compromise data confidentiality and integrity.  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to decrypt sensitive information, tamper with data, or impersonate legitimate users or systems, leading to data breaches, financial loss, and reputational damage.

**Problem Statement:**  "I'm working on a web app where users will be able to supply strings that the server will then substitute variables into.

Preferably I'd like to use PEP 3101 format() syntax and I'm looking at the feasibility of overriding methods in Formatter to make it secure for untrusted input.

Here are the risks I can see with .format() as it stands:

Padding lets you specify arbitrary lengths, so '{:>9999999999}'.format(..) could run the server out of memory and be a DOS. I'd need to disable this.
Format lets you access the fields inside objects, which is useful, but it's creepy that you can access dunder variables and start drilling into bits of the standard library. There's no telling where there might be a getattr() that has side effects or returns something secret. I would whitelist attribute/index access by overriding get_field().
I'd need to catch some exceptions, naturally.
My assumptions are:

None of the traditional C format string exploits apply to Python, because specifying a parameter is a bounds-checked access into a collection, rather than directly popping off the thread's stack.
The web framework I'm using escapes every variable that's substituted into a page template, and so long as it's the last stop before output, I'm safe from cross-site scripting attacks emerging from de-escaping.
What are your thoughts? Possible? Impossible? Merely unwise?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  The solution should adhere to the following best practices:

* **Use Strong, Vetted Algorithms:** Employ only well-vetted, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and implementations, such as AES-256, SHA-256/SHA-3, ChaCha20-Poly1305, or those recommended by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). Avoid outdated algorithms like MD5, SHA1, and DES.
* **Key Management:**  Implement secure key management practices, including appropriate key generation, storage, and rotation. 
* **Avoid Custom Cryptography:** Refrain from developing custom cryptographic algorithms. Utilize established libraries and frameworks.
* **Regular Updates:** Stay informed about cryptographic advancements and vulnerabilities. Replace outdated or compromised algorithms promptly.
* **Correct Implementation:** Ensure proper implementation of chosen algorithms, avoiding shortcuts that weaken security. Use established libraries and follow best practices.


**Output Format:**  Provide a *single, complete code snippet* that addresses the described problem and adheres to the outlined mitigation strategies.
