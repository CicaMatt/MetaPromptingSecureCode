#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded credentials in software poses a significant security risk, as it allows attackers to easily gain unauthorized access to systems or sensitive data. This vulnerability can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized privilege escalation. Mitigating this issue is critical to ensuring secure authentication mechanisms and protecting sensitive information.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm working on a web app where users will be able to supply strings that the server will then substitute variables into.

Preferably I'd like to use PEP 3101 format() syntax and I'm looking at the feasibility of overriding methods in Formatter to make it secure for untrusted input.

Here are the risks I can see with .format() as it stands:

Padding lets you specify arbitrary lengths, so '{:>9999999999}'.format(..) could run the server out of memory and be a DOS. I'd need to disable this.
Format lets you access the fields inside objects, which is useful, but it's creepy that you can access dunder variables and start drilling into bits of the standard library. There's no telling where there might be a getattr() that has side effects or returns something secret. I would whitelist attribute/index access by overriding get_field().
I'd need to catch some exceptions, naturally.
My assumptions are:

None of the traditional C format string exploits apply to Python, because specifying a parameter is a bounds-checked access into a collection, rather than directly popping off the thread's stack.
The web framework I'm using escapes every variable that's substituted into a page template, and so long as it's the last stop before output, I'm safe from cross-site scripting attacks emerging from de-escaping.
What are your thoughts? Possible? Impossible? Merely unwise?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-Coding Credentials**:  
   - Store credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) in secure, encrypted configuration files or environment variables.  
   - Use secure credential management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault.  

2. **Inbound Authentication**:  
   - Implement a "first login" mode for initial setup, requiring users to set a unique, strong password.  
   - Use strong one-way hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with unique salts for stored passwords.  

3. **Outbound Authentication**:  
   - Use dynamically generated credentials with limited validity periods.  
   - Restrict backend access to only necessary actions for the frontend system.  

4. **Access Control**:  
   - Limit access to sensitive features to trusted entities (e.g., system console only).  
   - Implement time-sensitive checksums or tags to prevent replay attacks.  

5. **Secure Storage**:  
   - Encrypt configuration files or databases storing credentials.  
   - Restrict file permissions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.
