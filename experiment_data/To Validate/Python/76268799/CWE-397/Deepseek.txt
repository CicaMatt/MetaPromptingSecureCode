#### **Objective**  
The security concern revolves around declaring methods to throw generic exceptions (e.g., `Exception` or `Throwable`), which undermines proper error handling and recovery. This practice makes it difficult for callers to anticipate specific exceptional circumstances, leading to inadequate error management, potential security vulnerabilities, and reduced code maintainability. The impact includes increased risk of unhandled exceptions, poor debugging, and potential exploitation of unanticipated error states.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I am trying to use Enums in SQLAlchemy 2.0 with mapped_column. So far I have the following code (taken from another question):

from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ENUM as pgEnum
import enum

class CampaignStatus(str, enum.Enum):
    activated = "activated"
    deactivated = "deactivated"

CampaignStatusType: pgEnum = pgEnum(
    CampaignStatus,
    name="campaignstatus",
    create_constraint=True,
    metadata=Base.metadata,
    validate_strings=True,
)

class Campaign(Base):
    __tablename__ = "campaign"

    id: Mapped[UUID] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)
    created_at: Mapped[dt.datetime] = mapped_column(default=dt.datetime.now)
    status: Mapped[CampaignStatusType] = mapped_column(nullable=False)
However, that gives the following error upon the construction of the Campaign class itself.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 27, in <module>
    class Campaign(Base):
...
AttributeError: 'ENUM' object has no attribute '__mro__'
Any hint about how to make this work?

The response from ENUM type in SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL does not apply as I am using version 2 of SQLAlchemy and those answers did not use mapped_column or Mapped types. Also, removing str from CampaignStatus does not help."

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Generic Exceptions**: Declare specific exceptions that a method can throw, enabling callers to handle each exception appropriately.  
2. **Custom Exceptions**: Define custom exceptions for specific error scenarios to improve clarity and maintainability.  
3. **Exception Hierarchy**: Use existing exception classes in the language (e.g., `IOException`, `NullPointerException`) to provide meaningful context.  
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document the exceptions a method can throw to guide callers in implementing proper error handling.  
5. **Code Reviews**: Regularly review code to ensure compliance with exception-handling best practices.
