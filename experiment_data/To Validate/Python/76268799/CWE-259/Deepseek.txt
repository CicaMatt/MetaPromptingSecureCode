#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded passwords poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and widespread exploitation. This issue is particularly dangerous because hard-coded credentials are often identical across installations, making them susceptible to large-scale attacks. The objective is to eliminate hard-coded passwords by implementing secure authentication mechanisms and storing credentials securely.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I am trying to use Enums in SQLAlchemy 2.0 with mapped_column. So far I have the following code (taken from another question):

from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ENUM as pgEnum
import enum

class CampaignStatus(str, enum.Enum):
    activated = "activated"
    deactivated = "deactivated"

CampaignStatusType: pgEnum = pgEnum(
    CampaignStatus,
    name="campaignstatus",
    create_constraint=True,
    metadata=Base.metadata,
    validate_strings=True,
)

class Campaign(Base):
    __tablename__ = "campaign"

    id: Mapped[UUID] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)
    created_at: Mapped[dt.datetime] = mapped_column(default=dt.datetime.now)
    status: Mapped[CampaignStatusType] = mapped_column(nullable=False)
However, that gives the following error upon the construction of the Campaign class itself.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 27, in <module>
    class Campaign(Base):
...
AttributeError: 'ENUM' object has no attribute '__mro__'
Any hint about how to make this work?

The response from ENUM type in SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL does not apply as I am using version 2 of SQLAlchemy and those answers did not use mapped_column or Mapped types. Also, removing str from CampaignStatus does not help."

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-coded Passwords**: Store passwords outside the code in a secure, encrypted configuration file or database.  
2. **Use Strong Password Policies**: For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique, strong password during initial setup.  
3. **Encrypt and Hash Passwords**: Apply strong one-way hashing with unique salts to stored passwords.  
4. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to sensitive features and ensure credentials are only accessible to authorized entities.  
5. **Dynamic Credentials**: For front-end to back-end connections, use dynamically generated, time-limited credentials with restricted permissions.
