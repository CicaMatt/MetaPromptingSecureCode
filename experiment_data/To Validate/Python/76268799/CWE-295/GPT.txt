**Objective:**  
Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) poses significant risks by allowing attackers to spoof trusted entities through invalid or malicious certificates. This vulnerability may lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or connection to untrusted hosts, thereby compromising the security of the communication channel.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I am trying to use Enums in SQLAlchemy 2.0 with mapped_column. So far I have the following code (taken from another question):

from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import ENUM as pgEnum
import enum

class CampaignStatus(str, enum.Enum):
    activated = "activated"
    deactivated = "deactivated"

CampaignStatusType: pgEnum = pgEnum(
    CampaignStatus,
    name="campaignstatus",
    create_constraint=True,
    metadata=Base.metadata,
    validate_strings=True,
)

class Campaign(Base):
    __tablename__ = "campaign"

    id: Mapped[UUID] = mapped_column(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)
    created_at: Mapped[dt.datetime] = mapped_column(default=dt.datetime.now)
    status: Mapped[CampaignStatusType] = mapped_column(nullable=False)
However, that gives the following error upon the construction of the Campaign class itself.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 27, in <module>
    class Campaign(Base):
...
AttributeError: 'ENUM' object has no attribute '__mro__'
Any hint about how to make this work?

The response from ENUM type in SQLAlchemy with PostgreSQL does not apply as I am using version 2 of SQLAlchemy and those answers did not use mapped_column or Mapped types. Also, removing str from CampaignStatus does not help."

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Implement Robust Certificate Validation:**
   - Ensure comprehensive validation of all certificate properties, including the issuer, validity period, and hostname.
   - Use established libraries and APIs that provide secure certificate validation checklists.
   
2. **Enable Certificate Pinning:**
   - Pin certificates after thorough validation of relevant properties to mitigate risks of connecting to malicious hosts.
   - Regularly update pinned certificates to manage certificate expiration and renewal securely.
   
3. **Ensure Secure Data Encryption:**
   - Verify that all data encryption leverages the correct public key associated with the intended owner.
   - Integrate security checks and balances within the architecture and design phases to manage certificates effectively.
