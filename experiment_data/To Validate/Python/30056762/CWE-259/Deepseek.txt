#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded passwords poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and widespread exploitation. This issue is particularly dangerous because hard-coded credentials are often identical across installations, making them susceptible to large-scale attacks. The objective is to eliminate hard-coded passwords by implementing secure authentication mechanisms and storing credentials securely.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I need help using RSA encryption and decryption in Python.

I am creating a private/public key pair, encrypting a message with keys and writing message to a file. Then I am reading ciphertext from file and decrypting text using key.

I am having trouble with the decryption portion. As you can see in my code below, when I put in decrypted = key.decrypt(message) that the program works, yet the decrypted message is encrypted again. It seems like it is not reading the ciphertext from the file.

Can anyone help me write this code so decryption reads ciphertext from file and then uses key to decrypt ciphertext?

import Crypto
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto import Random

random_generator = Random.new().read
key = RSA.generate(1024, random_generator) #generate public and private keys

publickey = key.publickey # pub key export for exchange

encrypted = publickey.encrypt('encrypt this message', 32)
#message to encrypt is in the above line 'encrypt this message'

print 'encrypted message:', encrypted #ciphertext

f = open ('encryption.txt', 'w'w)
f.write(str(encrypted)) #write ciphertext to file
f.close()

#decrypted code below

f = open ('encryption.txt', 'r')
message = f.read()

decrypted = key.decrypt(message)

print 'decrypted', decrypted

f = open ('encryption.txt', 'w')
f.write(str(message))
f.write(str(decrypted))
f.close()"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-coded Passwords**: Store passwords outside the code in a secure, encrypted configuration file or database.  
2. **Use Strong Password Policies**: For inbound authentication, require users to set a unique, strong password during initial setup.  
3. **Encrypt and Hash Passwords**: Apply strong one-way hashing with unique salts to stored passwords.  
4. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to sensitive features and ensure credentials are only accessible to authorized entities.  
5. **Dynamic Credentials**: For front-end to back-end connections, use dynamically generated, time-limited credentials with restricted permissions.
