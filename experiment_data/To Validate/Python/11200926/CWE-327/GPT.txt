#### Objective
Address the security risk posed by the use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms, known as CWE-327. Insecure cryptography can be exploited to expose sensitive information, modify data unexpectedly, or spoof identities. This issue is especially challenging in hardware deployment due to difficulty in updating flawed algorithms.

#### Problem Statement
"i am new to scrapy and decided to try it out because of good online reviews. I am trying to login to a website with scrapy. I have successfully logged in with a combination of selenium and mechanize by collecting the needed cookies with selenium and adding them to mechanize. Now I am trying to do something similar with scrapy and selenium but cant seem to get anything to work. I cant really even tell if anything is working or not. Can anyone please help me. Below is what Ive started on. I may not even need to transfer the cookies with scrapy but i cant tell if the thing ever actually logs in or not. Thanks

from scrapy.spider import BaseSpider
from scrapy.http import Response,FormRequest,Request
from scrapy.selector import HtmlXPathSelector
from selenium import webdriver

class MySpider(BaseSpider):
    name = 'MySpider'
    start_urls = ['http://my_domain.com/']

    def get_cookies(self):
        driver = webdriver.Firefox()
        driver.implicitly_wait(30)
        base_url = "http://www.my_domain.com/"
        driver.get(base_url)
        driver.find_element_by_name("USER").clear()
        driver.find_element_by_name("USER").send_keys("my_username")
        driver.find_element_by_name("PASSWORD").clear()
        driver.find_element_by_name("PASSWORD").send_keys("my_password")
        driver.find_element_by_name("submit").click()
        cookies = driver.get_cookies()
        driver.close()
        return cookies

    def parse(self, response,my_cookies=get_cookies):
        return Request(url="http://my_domain.com/",
            cookies=my_cookies,
            callback=self.login)

    def login(self,response):
        return [FormRequest.from_response(response,
            formname='login_form',
            formdata={'USER': 'my_username', 'PASSWORD': 'my_password'},
            callback=self.after_login)]

    def after_login(self, response):
        hxs = HtmlXPathSelector(response)
        print hxs.select('/html/head/title').extract()"

#### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Adopt Strong Algorithms:**
   - Use current, strong cryptographic algorithms vetted by experts, like AES or RSA, and adhere to standards such as FIPS 140-2.
   - Avoid custom or private algorithms to prevent easy exploitation by attackers.

2. **Periodic Review and Flexibility:**
   - Periodically review cryptographic implementations to ensure they remain secure.
   - Design systems to allow easy replacement of outdated algorithms, using uniform interfaces and wrappers where possible.

3. **Key Management:**
   - Protect cryptographic keys to ensure the overall strength of the cryptography.

4. **Use Reliable Libraries:**
   - Implement cryptographic operations using vetted libraries or frameworks, such as ESAPI, to reduce the risk of errors.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Follow industry-standard practices meticulously, ensuring all recommended steps are implemented without compromise.
