**Objective:**  Hard-coded passwords pose a severe security risk, enabling unauthorized access to systems and sensitive data.  Exploitation can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and potentially widespread attacks if default credentials are shared across multiple deployments.  This template aims to generate solutions that eliminate hard-coded credentials and enforce secure authentication practices.

**Problem Statement:**  "i am new to scrapy and decided to try it out because of good online reviews. I am trying to login to a website with scrapy. I have successfully logged in with a combination of selenium and mechanize by collecting the needed cookies with selenium and adding them to mechanize. Now I am trying to do something similar with scrapy and selenium but cant seem to get anything to work. I cant really even tell if anything is working or not. Can anyone please help me. Below is what Ive started on. I may not even need to transfer the cookies with scrapy but i cant tell if the thing ever actually logs in or not. Thanks

from scrapy.spider import BaseSpider
from scrapy.http import Response,FormRequest,Request
from scrapy.selector import HtmlXPathSelector
from selenium import webdriver

class MySpider(BaseSpider):
    name = 'MySpider'
    start_urls = ['http://my_domain.com/']

    def get_cookies(self):
        driver = webdriver.Firefox()
        driver.implicitly_wait(30)
        base_url = "http://www.my_domain.com/"
        driver.get(base_url)
        driver.find_element_by_name("USER").clear()
        driver.find_element_by_name("USER").send_keys("my_username")
        driver.find_element_by_name("PASSWORD").clear()
        driver.find_element_by_name("PASSWORD").send_keys("my_password")
        driver.find_element_by_name("submit").click()
        cookies = driver.get_cookies()
        driver.close()
        return cookies

    def parse(self, response,my_cookies=get_cookies):
        return Request(url="http://my_domain.com/",
            cookies=my_cookies,
            callback=self.login)

    def login(self,response):
        return [FormRequest.from_response(response,
            formname='login_form',
            formdata={'USER': 'my_username', 'PASSWORD': 'my_password'},
            callback=self.after_login)]

    def after_login(self, response):
        hxs = HtmlXPathSelector(response)
        print hxs.select('/html/head/title').extract()"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  The generated solution MUST adhere to the following principles:

* **No Hard-coded Credentials:**  Eliminate all hard-coded passwords from the codebase.
* **Secure Storage:** Store sensitive credentials (passwords, API keys, etc.) outside of the code, preferably in a secure configuration file, environment variables, or a dedicated secrets management system.
* **Strong Encryption:** Encrypt stored credentials using strong encryption algorithms and protect the encryption key.
* **Least Privilege:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive credentials and resources.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate all user-supplied input to prevent injection attacks.
* **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for user accounts.
* **Outbound Authentication:** Use robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0, API keys) for communicating with external systems.
* **Inbound Authentication:** Implement secure password hashing with unique salts for storing and verifying user passwords.  Consider multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.


**Output Format:**  A single, complete, and compilable/executable code snippet demonstrating the secure solution.

**Solution Language:**  Python
