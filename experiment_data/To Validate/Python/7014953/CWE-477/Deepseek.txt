#### **Objective**  
The use of obsolete functions in code poses significant security risks, including vulnerabilities to exploits, reduced maintainability, and potential non-compliance with modern security standards. Obsolete functions are often deprecated due to inherent flaws, inefficiencies, or lack of support, making them unsuitable for secure and reliable software development. Addressing this issue is critical to ensure robust, future-proof, and secure code.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm writing a small Python script which will periodically pull information from a 3rd party service using a username and password combo. I don't need to create something that is 100% bulletproof (does 100% even exist?), but I would like to involve a good measure of security so at the very least it would take a long time for someone to break it.

This script won't have a GUI and will be run periodically by cron, so entering a password each time it's run to decrypt things won't really work, and I'll have to store the username and password in either an encrypted file or encrypted in a SQLite database, which would be preferable as I'll be using SQLite anyway, and I might need to edit the password at some point. In addition, I'll probably be wrapping the whole program in an EXE, as it's exclusively for Windows at this point.

How can I securely store the username and password combo to be used periodically via a cron job?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Refer to Official Documentation**: Identify the obsolete function and review the official documentation to understand why it is deprecated and what alternatives are recommended.  
2. **Replace with Modern Alternatives**: Substitute the obsolete function with its modern, secure counterpart, ensuring compatibility with the current version of the programming language.  
3. **Validate Security Implications**: Assess the security impact of the replacement function to ensure it adheres to best practices and does not introduce new vulnerabilities.  
4. **Update Dependencies**: Ensure all libraries, frameworks, and tools are up-to-date to support the use of modern functions.  
5. **Conduct Code Reviews**: Perform thorough code reviews to identify and eliminate other instances of obsolete functions in the codebase.

#### **Output Format**  
The solution must be generated as a **single, complete, and executable code snippet** that replaces the obsolete function with its secure, modern alternative.
