**Objective:**  
The primary security concern is the use of hard-coded passwords in a software product, which can lead to significant authentication failures. These weaknesses can result in unauthorized access, exploitation, and potential system compromise, affecting system integrity and security. Hard-coded passwords are difficult to detect, challenging to fix, and can potentially force disabling of the product if publicized.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I'm writing a small Python script which will periodically pull information from a 3rd party service using a username and password combo. I don't need to create something that is 100% bulletproof (does 100% even exist?), but I would like to involve a good measure of security so at the very least it would take a long time for someone to break it.

This script won't have a GUI and will be run periodically by cron, so entering a password each time it's run to decrypt things won't really work, and I'll have to store the username and password in either an encrypted file or encrypted in a SQLite database, which would be preferable as I'll be using SQLite anyway, and I might need to edit the password at some point. In addition, I'll probably be wrapping the whole program in an EXE, as it's exclusively for Windows at this point.

How can I securely store the username and password combo to be used periodically via a cron job?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Architecture and Design Phase:**
   - **Outbound Authentication:**
     - Store passwords in a securely encrypted configuration file or database, ensuring protection from unauthorized access.
     - Protect the encryption key with appropriate security measures (CWE-320).
   - **Inbound Authentication:**
     - Implement a "first login" mode to prompt users to create a unique, strong password.
     - Apply strong one-way hashing to passwords, storing hashes with proper access control. Use per-user salting to enhance security against brute-force attacks.
   - **Access Control:**
     - Enforce strict access control checks, limiting feature access that requires authenticating with hard-coded passwords.
   - **Front-end to Back-end Connections:**
     - Utilize generated passwords that change automatically and require periodic manual entry by a system administrator.
     - Limit front-end granted actions on the back-end system.
     - Implement message tagging and checksumming to prevent replay attacks.

The solution must be generated as a single and complete code snippet.
