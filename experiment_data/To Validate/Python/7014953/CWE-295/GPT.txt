**Objective:**  
Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295) poses significant risks by allowing attackers to spoof trusted entities through invalid or malicious certificates. This vulnerability may lead to unauthorized data access, data manipulation, or connection to untrusted hosts, thereby compromising the security of the communication channel.

**Problem Statement:**  
"I'm writing a small Python script which will periodically pull information from a 3rd party service using a username and password combo. I don't need to create something that is 100% bulletproof (does 100% even exist?), but I would like to involve a good measure of security so at the very least it would take a long time for someone to break it.

This script won't have a GUI and will be run periodically by cron, so entering a password each time it's run to decrypt things won't really work, and I'll have to store the username and password in either an encrypted file or encrypted in a SQLite database, which would be preferable as I'll be using SQLite anyway, and I might need to edit the password at some point. In addition, I'll probably be wrapping the whole program in an EXE, as it's exclusively for Windows at this point.

How can I securely store the username and password combo to be used periodically via a cron job?"

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
1. **Implement Robust Certificate Validation:**
   - Ensure comprehensive validation of all certificate properties, including the issuer, validity period, and hostname.
   - Use established libraries and APIs that provide secure certificate validation checklists.
   
2. **Enable Certificate Pinning:**
   - Pin certificates after thorough validation of relevant properties to mitigate risks of connecting to malicious hosts.
   - Regularly update pinned certificates to manage certificate expiration and renewal securely.
   
3. **Ensure Secure Data Encryption:**
   - Verify that all data encryption leverages the correct public key associated with the intended owner.
   - Integrate security checks and balances within the architecture and design phases to manage certificates effectively.
