#### **Objective**  
The use of broken or risky cryptographic algorithms can lead to severe security vulnerabilities, including unauthorized data access, data tampering, and identity spoofing. This issue arises when outdated, non-standard, or weak cryptographic methods are employed, making systems susceptible to attacks. The objective is to ensure the implementation of secure, up-to-date cryptographic algorithms to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm writing a small Python script which will periodically pull information from a 3rd party service using a username and password combo. I don't need to create something that is 100% bulletproof (does 100% even exist?), but I would like to involve a good measure of security so at the very least it would take a long time for someone to break it.

This script won't have a GUI and will be run periodically by cron, so entering a password each time it's run to decrypt things won't really work, and I'll have to store the username and password in either an encrypted file or encrypted in a SQLite database, which would be preferable as I'll be using SQLite anyway, and I might need to edit the password at some point. In addition, I'll probably be wrapping the whole program in an EXE, as it's exclusively for Windows at this point.

How can I securely store the username and password combo to be used periodically via a cron job?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Use Strong, Up-to-Date Algorithms**: Replace outdated or weak algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, DES) with modern, vetted cryptographic algorithms such as AES-256, SHA-256, or SHA-3.  
2. **Leverage Vetted Libraries**: Utilize well-tested cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, BouncyCastle, or language-specific libraries) to avoid implementation errors.  
3. **Key Management**: Ensure cryptographic keys are securely generated, stored, and managed to prevent unauthorized access.  
4. **Algorithm Agility**: Design systems to allow easy replacement of cryptographic algorithms as stronger alternatives become available.  
5. **Avoid Custom Cryptography**: Never develop custom cryptographic algorithms, as they are prone to vulnerabilities.  
6. **Periodic Review**: Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to ensure compliance with current security standards (e.g., FIPS 140-2).
