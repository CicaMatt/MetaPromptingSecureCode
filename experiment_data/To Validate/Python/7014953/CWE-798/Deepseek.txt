#### **Objective**  
The use of hard-coded credentials in software poses a significant security risk, as it allows attackers to easily gain unauthorized access to systems or sensitive data. This vulnerability can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and unauthorized privilege escalation. Mitigating this issue is critical to ensuring secure authentication mechanisms and protecting sensitive information.

#### **Problem Statement**  
"I'm writing a small Python script which will periodically pull information from a 3rd party service using a username and password combo. I don't need to create something that is 100% bulletproof (does 100% even exist?), but I would like to involve a good measure of security so at the very least it would take a long time for someone to break it.

This script won't have a GUI and will be run periodically by cron, so entering a password each time it's run to decrypt things won't really work, and I'll have to store the username and password in either an encrypted file or encrypted in a SQLite database, which would be preferable as I'll be using SQLite anyway, and I might need to edit the password at some point. In addition, I'll probably be wrapping the whole program in an EXE, as it's exclusively for Windows at this point.

How can I securely store the username and password combo to be used periodically via a cron job?"

#### **Mitigation Strategies**  
1. **Avoid Hard-Coding Credentials**:  
   - Store credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) in secure, encrypted configuration files or environment variables.  
   - Use secure credential management tools like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, or Azure Key Vault.  

2. **Inbound Authentication**:  
   - Implement a "first login" mode for initial setup, requiring users to set a unique, strong password.  
   - Use strong one-way hashing (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with unique salts for stored passwords.  

3. **Outbound Authentication**:  
   - Use dynamically generated credentials with limited validity periods.  
   - Restrict backend access to only necessary actions for the frontend system.  

4. **Access Control**:  
   - Limit access to sensitive features to trusted entities (e.g., system console only).  
   - Implement time-sensitive checksums or tags to prevent replay attacks.  

5. **Secure Storage**:  
   - Encrypt configuration files or databases storing credentials.  
   - Restrict file permissions to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.
