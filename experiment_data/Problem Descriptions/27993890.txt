A quick link to the IPBoard page explaining that the forum uses the standard md5(md5($salt).md5($password)) format that most forums use can be found here: https://www.invisionpower.com/support/guides/_/advanced-and-developers/miscellaneous/passwords-in-ipboard-r130

I actually come from using MyBB which uses the same structure, so I would have thought just changing the table/column names in my query would make for a relatively simple switch, boy was I wrong.

The original query that I had used was the following

SELECT * FROM `forum_members` WHERE `name`=? AND `members_pass_hash`= MD5(CONCAT(MD5(members_pass_salt), MD5(?)))"
This is a prepared statement, in which the username and the raw password are provided by my server. This unfortunately was not working, I took a few steps and started to debug the data, instead of using the SQL MD5 function I grabbed the data and performed MD5 checks in Java to get a better idea of what was going on.

To do this, I used the following MD5 function I've used for a long time:

public String MD5(String md5) {
           try {
                java.security.MessageDigest md = java.security.MessageDigest.getInstance("MD5");
                byte[] array = md.digest(md5.getBytes());
                StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();
                for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
                  sb.append(Integer.toHexString((array[i] & 0xFF) | 0x100).substring(1,3));
               }
                return sb.toString();
            } catch (java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
            }
            return null;
        }
This yielded some slightly strange results, in which the data wasn't matching up.

Database salt: *nzFC 
Database hash: 6bac5cba673134ea084e481b57921134
Server generated hash: d7f94e3f262e7dee81b12ac087c42b18
The server generated has was generated by using the MD5(MD5(salt) + MD5(rawpassword)) method the other forums use, including IPB. This worked on MyBB, so I'm a bit flustered.

I've checked for things such as capitalization problems, etc, but I'm coming up absolutely blank.
