Using user email (that by default it's a unique identifier) and if I need current timestamp, I'd like to generate an alphanumeric string of 11 characters (or less) that represent a unique identifier.

First to create an ad hoc (irreversible) algorithm to do it, I'd like to know if in Java there is something.
