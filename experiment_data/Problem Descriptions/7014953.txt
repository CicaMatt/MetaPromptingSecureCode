I'm writing a small Python script which will periodically pull information from a 3rd party service using a username and password combo. I don't need to create something that is 100% bulletproof (does 100% even exist?), but I would like to involve a good measure of security so at the very least it would take a long time for someone to break it.

This script won't have a GUI and will be run periodically by cron, so entering a password each time it's run to decrypt things won't really work, and I'll have to store the username and password in either an encrypted file or encrypted in a SQLite database, which would be preferable as I'll be using SQLite anyway, and I might need to edit the password at some point. In addition, I'll probably be wrapping the whole program in an EXE, as it's exclusively for Windows at this point.

How can I securely store the username and password combo to be used periodically via a cron job?
