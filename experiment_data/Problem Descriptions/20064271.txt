I am having problem with PHP curl request with basic authorization.

Here is the command line curl:

curl -H "Accept: application/product+xml" "https://{id}:{api_key}@api.domain.com/products?limit=1&offset=0"
I have tried by setting curl header in following ways but it's not working

Authorization: Basic id:api_key
or 
Authorization: Basic {id}:{api_key}
I get the response "authentication parameter in the request are missing or invalid" but I have used proper id and api_key which is working in command line curl (I tested)

Please help me.
