I am new to using prepared statements in mysql with php. I need some help creating a prepared statement to retrieve columns.

I need to get information from different columns. Currently for a test file, I use the completely unsecure SQL statement:

$qry = "SELECT * FROM mytable where userid='{$_GET['userid']}' AND category='{$_GET['category']}'ORDER BY id DESC"
$result = mysql_query($qry) or die(mysql_error()); 
Can someone help me create a secure mysql statement using input from url parameters (as above) that is prepared?

BONUS: Prepared statements are suppose to increase speed as well. Will it increase overall speed if I only use a prepared statement three or four times on a page?
