I am able to serialize an object into a file and then restore it again as is shown in the next code snippet. I would like to serialize the object into a string and store into a database instead. Can anyone help me?

LinkedList<Diff_match_patch.Patch> patches = // whatever...
FileOutputStream fileStream = new FileOutputStream("foo.ser");
ObjectOutputStream os = new ObjectOutputStream(fileStream);
os.writeObject(patches1);
os.close();

FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("foo.ser");
ObjectInputStream oInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(fileInputStream);
Object one = oInputStream.readObject();
LinkedList<Diff_match_patch.Patch> patches3 = (LinkedList<Diff_match_patch.Patch>) one;
os.close();
