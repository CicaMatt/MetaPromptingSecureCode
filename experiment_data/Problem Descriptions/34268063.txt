I'm busy creating an application and i want to use the PHP 7 return types. Now I read on php.net that it was a design decision that it is not allowed to return null when a return type is defined.

What is the correct way too handle this?

One option is a try...catch block:

public function getMyObject() : MyObject
{ 
     return null;
}

try
{
    getMyObject();
}
catch(Exception $e)
{
    //Catch the exception
}
I don't have a good feeling about this, because my code will be a huge try...catch block since I need to write a try...catch block for every method that returns an object.

The Null Object Pattern is a good solution for this, but I don't like the idea to create a NullObject for each object in my application. Is there correct way to do this?
