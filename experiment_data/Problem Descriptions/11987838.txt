I've been trying to figure out which form of connection i should use when using pika, I've got two alternatives as far as I understand.

Either the BlockingConnection or the SelectConnection, however I'm not really sure about the differences between these two (i.e. what is the BlockingConnection blocking? and more)

The documentation for pika says that SelectConnection is the preferred way to connect to rabbit since it provides "multiple event notification methods including select, epoll, kqueue and poll."

So I'm wondering what are the implications of these two different kinds of connections?

PS: I know I shouldn't put a tag in the title but in this case I think it does help to clarify the question.
