I'm trying to call ~ 300 API calls at the same time, so that I would get the results in a couple of seconds max.

My pseudo-code looks like this:

def function_1():
    colors = ['yellow', 'green', 'blue', + ~300 other ones]
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    res = loop.run_until_complete(get_color_info(colors))

async def get_color_info(colors):
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    responses = []
    for color in colors:
        print("getting color")
        url = "https://api.com/{}/".format(color)
        data = loop.run_in_executor(None, requests.get, url)
        r = await data
        responses.append(r.json())
    return responses
Doing this I get getting color printed out every second or so and the code takes forever, so I'm pretty sure they don't run simultaneously. What am I doing wrong?
