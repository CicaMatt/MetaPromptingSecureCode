Hey having some trouble trying to maintain transparency on a png when i create a thumbnail from it, anyone any experience with this? any help would be great, here's what i am currently doing:

$fileName= "../js/ajaxupload/tees/".$fileName;

list($width, $height) = getimagesize($fileName);

$newwidth = 257;
$newheight = 197;

$thumb = imagecreatetruecolor($newwidth, $newheight);
imagealphablending($thumb, true);
$source = imagecreatefrompng($fileName);
imagealphablending($source, true);

imagecopyresized($thumb, $source, 0, 0, 0, 0, $newwidth, $newheight, $width, $height);

imagesavealpha($thumb, true);
imagepng($thumb,$newFilename);
