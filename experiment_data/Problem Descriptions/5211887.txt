I am looking to set curl to use a proxy server. The url is provided by an html form, which has not been a problem. Without the proxy it works fine. I have found code on this and other sites, but they do not work. Any help in finding the correct solution would be much appreciated. I feel that the bellow are close, but that I am missing something. Thank You.

The bellow code I adapted from here http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum88/10572.htm but it returns an error message about a missing T_VARIABLE on line 12.

<?

$url = '$_POST[1]';
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL,$url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPPROXYTUNNEL, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXY, '66.96.200.39:80');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST,'GET');
curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1)
curl_exec ($ch); 
$curl_info = curl_getinfo($ch);
curl_close($ch);
echo '<br />';
print_r($curl_info);
?>
The bellow is from curl through proxy returns no content

<?

$proxy = "66.96.200.39:80";
$proxy = explode(':', $proxy);
$url = "$_POST[1]";

$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXY, $proxy[0]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_PROXYPORT, $proxy[1]);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 1);

$exec = curl_exec($ch);

echo curl_error($ch);
print_r(curl_getinfo($ch));
echo $exec;
?>
