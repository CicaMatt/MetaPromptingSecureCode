NOTE: How to use basic authorization in PHP curl Does not work for me.

Trying to Curl into Electrum, but it looks like my access is denied. Electrum is on the same server as the php script. I have purposefully left out any command for the wallet for simplification purpose. Focusing on connecting first.

When trying to CURL in terminal

curl --data-binary '{"id":"curltext","method":"addrequest","params":{"amount":"3.14","memo":"test"}}' http://user:pass@127.0.0.1:7777
Error Message

curl: (7) Failed to connect to 127.0.0.1 port 7777: Connection refused
