I want to record how much memory (in bytes, hopefully) an object takes up for a project (I'm comparing sizes of data structures) and it seems like there is no method to do this in Java. Supposedly, C/C++ has sizeOf() method, but this is nonexistant in Java. I tried recording the free memory in the JVM with Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory() before and after creating the object and then recording the difference, but it would only give 0 or 131304, and nothing in between, regardless of the number of elements in the structure. Help please!
