So I've followed this tutorial but it doesn't seem to do anything. Simply nothing. It waits a few seconds and closes the program. What is wrong with this code?

import cv2
vidcap = cv2.VideoCapture('Compton.mp4')
success,image = vidcap.read()
count = 0
success = True
while success:
  success,image = vidcap.read()
  cv2.imwrite("frame%d.jpg" % count, image)     # save frame as JPEG file
  if cv2.waitKey(10) == 27:                     # exit if Escape is hit
      break
  count += 1
Also, in the comments it says that this limits the frames to 1000? Why?

EDIT: I tried doing success = True first but that didn't help. It only created one image that was 0 bytes.
