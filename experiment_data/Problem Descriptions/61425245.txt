I am working on a python web scraping project. The website I am trying to scrape data from contains info about all the medicines sold in India. The website requires a user to login before giving access to this information.

I want to access all the links in this url https://mims.com/india/browse/alphabet/a?cat=drug&tab=brand and store it in an array.

Here is my code for logging into the website

##################################### Method 1
import mechanize
import http.cookiejar as cookielib
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import html2text

br = mechanize.Browser()
cj = cookielib.LWPCookieJar()

br.set_cookiejar(cj)

br.set_handle_equiv(True)
br.set_handle_gzip(True)
br.set_handle_redirect(True)
br.set_handle_referer(True)
br.set_handle_robots(False)
br.set_handle_refresh(mechanize._http.HTTPRefreshProcessor(), max_time=1)

br.addheaders = [('User-agent', 'Chrome')]

br.open('https://sso.mims.com/Account/SignIn')

# View available forms
for f in br.forms():
    print(f)

br.select_form(nr=0)

# User credentials
br.form['EmailAddress'] = <USERNAME>
br.form['Password'] = <PASSWORD>

# Login
br.submit()
print(br.open('https://mims.com/india/browse/alphabet/a?cat=drug&tab=brand').read())

But the problem is that when the credentials are submitted, a middle page pops up with the following information.

You will be redirected to your destination shortly.
This page submits a hidden form and only then is the required end page shown. I want to access the end page. But br.open('https://mims.com/india/browse/alphabet/a?cat=drug&tab=brand').read() accesses the middle page and prints the results.

How do I wait for the middle page to submit the hidden form and then access the contents of the end page?
