How can you create a temporary FIFO (named pipe) in Python? This should work:

import tempfile

temp_file_name = mktemp()
os.mkfifo(temp_file_name)
open(temp_file_name, os.O_WRONLY)
# ... some process, somewhere, will read it ...
However, I'm hesitant because of the big warning in Python Docs 11.6 and potential removal because it's deprecated.

EDIT: It's noteworthy that I've tried tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile (and by extension tempfile.mkstemp), but os.mkfifo throws:

OSError -17: File already exists

when you run it on the files that mkstemp/NamedTemporaryFile have created.
