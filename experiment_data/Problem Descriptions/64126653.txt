I need to decrypt a file encrypted on OpenSSL with python but I am not understanding the options of pycrypto.

Here what I do in OpenSSL

openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -a -salt -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -in "clear.txt" -out "crypt.txt" -pass pass:"mypassword"

openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -a -pbkdf2 -iter 100000 -in "crypt.txt" -out "out.txt" -pass pass:"mypassword"

I tried (which obviously won't work)

obj2 = AES.new("mypassword", AES.MODE_CBC)
output = obj2.decrypt(text)
I just want to do the second step in python, but when looking at the sample:

https://pypi.org/project/pycrypto/

obj2 = AES.new('This is a key123', AES.MODE_CBC, 'This is an IV456')
obj2.decrypt(ciphertext)
I don't need IV, How do I specify the salt? the pbkdf2 hash? I am also looked at this thread

How to decrypt OpenSSL AES-encrypted files in Python?

but did not help.

Can someone show me how to do this using python?

thank you.
