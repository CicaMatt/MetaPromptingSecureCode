I'm trying to send an image to a website using Java HTTP POST requests.

I'm using the base code used here Upload files from Java client to a HTTP server:

This is my modification:

String urlToConnect = "http://localhost:9000/upload";
File fileToUpload = new File("C:\\Users\\joao\\Pictures\\bla.jpg");
String boundary = Long.toHexString(System.currentTimeMillis()); // Just generate some unique random value.

URLConnection connection = new URL(urlToConnect).openConnection();
connection.setDoOutput(true); // This sets request method to POST.
connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "multipart/form-data; boundary=" + boundary);
PrintWriter writer = null;
try {
    writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(connection.getOutputStream()));
    writer.println("--" + boundary);
    writer.println("Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"picture\"; filename=\"bla.jpg\"");
    writer.println("Content-Type: image/jpeg");
    writer.println();
    BufferedReader reader = null;
    try {
        reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(fileToUpload)));
        for (String line; (line = reader.readLine()) != null;) {
            writer.println(line);
        }
    } finally {
        if (reader != null) try { reader.close(); } catch (IOException logOrIgnore) {}
    }
    writer.println("--" + boundary + "--");
} finally {
    if (writer != null) writer.close();
}

// Connection is lazily executed whenever you request any status.
int responseCode = ((HttpURLConnection) connection).getResponseCode();
System.out.println(responseCode); // Should be 200
I get a 200 response code in the end, but the image is buggy, as in, random colors, which make me think it's an error in character encoding. I tried using UTF-8 as in the original example, but that just creates a corrupt image.

I am also 100% sure it's not a serverside problem, because I can use rest clients such as Advanced Rest Client/Postman and they can send an image with no problems.

Can you help me pinpoint what's wrong? Thank you.
